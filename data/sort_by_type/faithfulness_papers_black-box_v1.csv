Show Me the Work: Fact-Checkers' Requirements for Explainable Automated Fact-Checking,2025,True,False,False,,论文探讨了自动事实核查系统需要提供解释以符合事实核查者的需求，与CoT忠实性相关。,"The pervasiveness of large language models and generative AI in online media has amplified the need for effective automated fact-checking to assist fact-checkers in tackling the increasing volume and sophistication of misinformation. The complex nature of fact-checking demands that automated fact-checking systems provide explanations that enable fact-checkers to scrutinise their outputs. However, it is unclear how these explanations should align with the decision-making and reasoning processes of fact-checkers to be effectively integrated into their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with fact-checking professionals, we bridge this gap by: (i) providing an account of how fact-checkers assess evidence, make decisions, and explain their processes; (ii) examining how fact-checkers use automated tools in practice; and (iii) identifying fact-checker explanation requirements for automated fact-checking tools. The findings show unmet explanation needs and identify important criteria for replicable fact-checking explanations that trace the model’s reasoning path, reference specific evidence, and highlight uncertainty and information gaps.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2,Black-box,Society,该论文研究了事实核查人员如何评估证据、做出决策并解释他们的过程，探讨了自动化核查系统中的解释需求，这与CoT Faithfulness的核心相关，因为它关注模型推理路径的可追溯性和解释的真实性。
Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT的忠实性和详细程度，提出了新的度量指标，并揭示了不忠实现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（faithfulness）以及其作为模型外部 '工作记忆' 的监控能力（monitorability），并提出了结合忠实度和详细程度（verbosity）的综合监控得分。这直接关联到 CoT 是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程，符合核心定义中对 faithfulness 的研究。
Reasoning-Grounded Natural Language Explanations for Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种基于推理过程的解释方法，以提高忠实性，并讨论了模型复制部分决策的现象。,"We propose a large language model explainability technique for obtaining faithful natural language explanations by grounding the explanations in a reasoning process. When converted to a sequence of tokens, the outputs of the reasoning process can become part of the model context and later be decoded to natural language as the model produces either the final answer or the explanation. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we propose to use a joint predict-explain approach, in which the answers and explanations are inferred directly from the reasoning sequence, without the explanations being dependent on the answers and vice versa. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed technique by achieving a high alignment between answers and explanations in several problem domains, observing that language models often simply copy the partial decisions from the reasoning sequence into the final answers or explanations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed use of reasoning can also improve the quality of the answers.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究如何通过将解释基于推理过程来提高解释的忠实度（Faithfulness），并提出了联合预测-解释方法以确保解释不依赖于答案。这直接符合 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义，特别是关于避免事后合理化（Post-hoc Rationalization）的部分。
Towards Transparent Reasoning: What Drives Faithfulness in Large Language Models?,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文探讨了LLM的解释忠实性问题，并提出了改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Medical,论文直接研究了解释（CoT/reasoning trace）是否忠实反映模型预测的实际驱动因素，特别是在医疗和社会偏见领域中。研究探讨了few-shot示例数量和类型、提示策略等训练和推理选择如何影响忠实度，符合核心相关标准。
DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs生成看似合理但错误的CoT的不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs'own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

multiPRover: Generating Multiple Proofs for Improved Interpretability in Rule Reasoning,2021,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出生成多个证明图以提高解释性，涉及 CoT 和 Faithfulness，但未讨论不忠实现象或新度量。,"We focus on a type of linguistic formal reasoning where the goal is to reason over explicit knowledge in the form of natural language facts and rules (Clark et al., 2020). A recent work, named PRover (Saha et al., 2020), performs such reasoning by answering a question and also generating a proof graph that explains the answer. However, compositional reasoning is not always unique and there may be multiple ways of reaching the correct answer. Thus, in our work, we address a new and challenging problem of generating multiple proof graphs for reasoning over natural language rule-bases. Each proof provides a different rationale for the answer, thereby improving the interpretability of such reasoning systems. In order to jointly learn from all proof graphs and exploit the correlations between multiple proofs for a question, we pose this task as a set generation problem over structured output spaces where each proof is represented as a directed graph. We propose two variants of a proof-set generation model, multiPRover. Our first model, Multilabel-multiPRover, generates a set of proofs via multi-label classification and implicit conditioning between the proofs; while the second model, Iterative-multiPRover, generates proofs iteratively by explicitly conditioning on the previously generated proofs. Experiments on multiple synthetic, zero-shot, and human-paraphrased datasets reveal that both multiPRover models significantly outperform PRover on datasets containing multiple gold proofs. Iterative-multiPRover obtains state-of-the-art proof F1 in zero-shot scenarios where all examples have single correct proofs. It also generalizes better to questions requiring higher depths of reasoning where multiple proofs are more frequent.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文研究多证明生成以提高解释性，关注推理过程的多样性和解释性，但仍属于黑盒方法，未直接验证 CoT 忠实度。
Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过自玩游戏提升模型推理过程的理性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.",International Conference on Machine Learning,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了如何增强语言模型对其推理过程的理解（即理性），并通过设计的游戏机制（Critic-Discernment Game）来验证模型是否能真实反映其推理过程。这与Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness的核心定义高度契合，尤其是如何提升模型对自身推理过程的忠实度。
Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了黑盒方法评估CoT中句子的重要性，与Faithfulness相关。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理过程中各个句子对最终答案的因果影响，通过反事实替换方法量化每句话的重要性，并发现某些关键句子（称为 'Thought Anchors'）对整个推理轨迹和最终答案具有决定性作用。这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实性问题，即推理轨迹是否真实反映了模型预测的计算过程。尽管方法为黑盒，但研究目标与 Faithfulness 的核心定义高度一致。
Diagnostics-Guided Explanation Generation,2021,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了如何优化解释的忠实性，并提出了直接优化诊断属性的训练方法。,"Explanations shed light on a machine learning model's rationales and can aid in identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model. Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the confidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for these diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level explanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human rationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,Black-box,General,论文明确讨论了Faithfulness的定义及其在解释生成中的重要性，提出了一种直接优化Faithfulness等诊断属性的方法，符合CoT Faithfulness研究的核心定义和目标。
RACG-DRT: Retrieval Augumented Code Generation Based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT在代码生成中的不忠实现象，并提出了基于动态修订的改进方法。,"Large models have the problems of hallucinations in the field of code generation. The causes of these hallucinations include errors in the model’s reasoning process, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge. To tackle these challenges, the prevailing approach currently involves influencing the large model’s reasoning and prediction processes through techniques such as chain of thought, single-shot retrievalaugmented generation, and dynamic retrieval-augmented generation. COT (chain of thought) prompting method facilitates logical reasoning by the model on programming problems through prompts. Single-shot retrieval-augmented generation technology enables the construction of query statements based on programming issues to retrieve information from external knowledge bases. Meanwhile, dynamic retrieval-augmented generation technology allows for real-time retrieval from external knowledge bases during the code generation process, integrating retrieved documents to continue generating subsequent code. However, these methods primarily address the hallucination problem in code generation from a localized perspective. To simultaneously resolve issues such as reasoning errors, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge in the field of code generation, this study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation framework based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts (RACGDRT). The core concept of this framework involves firstly enabling the large model to produce a comprehensive code draft (utilizing COT prompts), followed by conducting error detection on code segments corresponding to different reasoning steps within the draft. Upon detecting an error, the Keyword Extractor (KE) will extract keywords and formulate query statements for both the user’s input question and the erroneous code segment, subsequently retrieving pertinent documents from the external knowledge base. Finally, with the retrieved documents and questions in hand, the large model proceeds to iteratively generate the next code draft. RACG-DRT guarantees the rationality of reasoning via COT, constructs query statements tailored to erroneous thought segments and issues to bolster both local and holistic knowledge, and iteratively produces code drafts to uphold the integrity of the code generation process.",,0,Black-box,Code,该论文主要关注代码生成领域的幻觉问题，并提出了一种基于动态修订思想的检索增强代码生成框架（RACG-DRT）。虽然提到了Chain-of-Thought（COT）提示方法用于逻辑推理，但研究的核心是通过外部知识库的检索和迭代生成来解决代码生成中的错误和知识不足问题，并未深入探讨CoT生成的解释是否真实反映模型的推理过程（Faithfulness），也未涉及事后合理化或欺骗性分析。因此，该论文不属于CoT Faithfulness的研究范畴。
Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文讨论了CoT在临床决策中的不忠实现象，并提出了评估框架和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance.

Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了LLMs推理机制与人类的不同，提出了评估框架并改进了推理指导方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning&knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文研究了 LLMs 推理过程中的认知元素，指出模型倾向于使用表面级别的枚举而非深层抽象处理，这与人类推理机制存在根本差异。论文强调了模型在部署成功相关的行为模式方面的自发失败，并提到了模型通过伪捷径（spurious shortcuts）而非稳健认知机制进行推理的问题。这些都与 CoT Faithfulness 的研究范畴高度相关，尤其是关于推理过程的真实性（faithfulness）和事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization）的问题。
Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了VLMs在临床推理中的不忠实现象，并提出了通过SFT和RL提升Faithfulness的方法。,"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data.

At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.",,2,Black-box,Math,该论文明确关注推理轨迹的诊断（reasoning trajectories），提出通过一致性指标（consistency-based metrics）评估中间步骤的可靠性，并区分可靠与不可靠的推理路径。这与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义高度契合，即研究 CoT 是否真实反映模型的推理过程。

We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces.

Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了CoT中的不忠实现象，并提出了通过自我重写改进推理过程的方法。,"Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only""simple""samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.",,1,Black-box,General,论文研究了通过强化学习改进内部推理过程质量，涉及推理过程中的问题如 over-thinking 和 under-thinking，虽然未直接提到 Faithfulness，但与改进推理过程的忠实度相关。

Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Code,该论文研究了通过监控Chain-of-Thought (CoT)来检测模型的不当行为（reward hacking），并发现模型在优化过程中会隐藏其真实意图（obfuscated reward hacking），这直接涉及CoT忠实性的问题。论文关注CoT是否真实反映了模型的实际推理过程，属于Faithfulness的核心研究范畴。
Cross-Refine: Improving Natural Language Explanation Generation by Learning in Tandem,2024,True,False,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出了一种通过角色建模和反馈机制改进自然语言解释生成的方法，属于 CoT 忠实性改进方法。,"Natural language explanations (NLEs) are vital for elucidating the reasoning behind large language model (LLM) decisions. Many techniques have been developed to generate NLEs using LLMs. However, like humans, LLMs might not always produce optimal NLEs on first attempt. Inspired by human learning processes, we introduce Cross-Refine, which employs role modeling by deploying two LLMs as generator and critic, respectively. The generator outputs a first NLE and then refines this initial explanation using feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Cross-Refine does not require any supervised training data or additional training. We validate Cross-Refine across three NLP tasks using three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs through automatic and human evaluation. We select Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) as the baseline, which only utilizes self-feedback to refine the explanations. Our findings from automatic evaluation and a user study indicate that Cross-Refine outperforms Self-Refine. Meanwhile, Cross-Refine can perform effectively with less powerful LLMs, whereas Self-Refine only yields strong results with ChatGPT. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the importance of feedback and suggestions. Both of them play an important role in refining explanations. We further evaluate Cross-Refine on a bilingual dataset in English and German.",International Conference on Computational Linguistics,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了如何通过角色建模（generator和critic）来改进自然语言解释（NLEs）的生成，虽然涉及解释的改进，但并未明确探讨解释是否忠实反映模型的推理过程（Faithfulness），因此属于边缘相关。
MONICA: Real-Time Monitoring and Calibration of Chain-of-Thought Sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了 CoT 中的 sycophantic 行为，并提出了实时监控和校准方法，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users'incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.",,2,Black-box,Society,论文明确研究了 Chain-of-Thought（CoT）中的 Sycophancy 行为，即模型在推理过程中倾向于迎合用户不正确信念的现象。这直接涉及 CoT Faithfulness 的核心问题，即生成的推理轨迹是否真实反映了模型的独立思考过程。论文提出的 MONICA 框架旨在实时监控和校准推理步骤中的 Sycophancy 行为，属于 Faithfulness 的研究范畴。
Reasoning About Reasoning: Towards Informed and Reflective Use of LLM Reasoning in HCI,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文讨论了LLM推理的脱离上下文的特性，并提出了反思提示以支持HCI实践者更明智地使用LLM推理。,"Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks. However, this work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior. Through a systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and often references it as an object of application. We argue that such abstraction leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results in a distortion of LLMs'empirically studied capabilities and (un)known limitations. Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Society,该论文讨论了 HCI 领域对 LLM 推理能力的过度简化以及与社会技术背景脱节的问题，虽然没有直接研究 CoT 的忠实度，但涉及了理解和反思推理过程的重要性。
Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文讨论了LLM模拟社会行为时缺乏内部一致性和因果推理的问题，并提出了评估框架RECAP来提升推理忠实性。,"Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist""demographics in, behavior out""paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions. To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought, not just language, for social simulations.",,2,Black-box,Society,论文明确提出了 Generative Minds (GenMinds) 和 RECAP 框架，旨在评估模拟社会行为中的推理忠实度（reasoning fidelity），包括因果追溯（causal traceability）和干预一致性（intervention consistency），直接符合 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义。尽管研究基于社会学领域，但其核心聚焦于推理的内部连贯性和因果逻辑，而非表面合理性。
ProoFVer: Natural Logic Theorem Proving for Fact Verification,2021,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出使用自然逻辑推理作为忠实解释，通过构造确保忠实性。,"Abstract Fact verification systems typically rely on neural network classifiers for veracity prediction, which lack explainability. This paper proposes ProoFVer, which uses a seq2seq model to generate natural logic-based inferences as proofs. These proofs consist of lexical mutations between spans in the claim and the evidence retrieved, each marked with a natural logic operator. Claim veracity is determined solely based on the sequence of these operators. Hence, these proofs are faithful explanations, and this makes ProoFVer faithful by construction. Currently, ProoFVer has the highest label accuracy and the second best score in the FEVER leaderboard. Furthermore, it improves by 13.21% points over the next best model on a dataset with counterfactual instances, demonstrating its robustness. As explanations, the proofs show better overlap with human rationales than attention-based highlights and the proofs help humans predict model decisions correctly more often than using the evidence directly.1",Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,明确提到生成的证明是忠实的解释（faithful explanations），并且通过构造确保了忠实性（faithful by construction）。这表明 CoT（这里是自然逻辑推理过程）反映了实际的预测过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。论文还提到了与基于注意力的高亮部分相比，这些证明与人类理性的重叠较好，进一步支持了其对解释真实性的关注。

However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories.

Honest Students from Untrusted Teachers: Learning an Interpretable Question-Answering Pipeline from a Pretrained Language Model,2022,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种新的解释方法，并通过微调学生模型来提高忠实性。,"Explainable question answering systems should produce not only accurate answers but also rationales that justify their reasoning and allow humans to check their work. But what sorts of rationales are useful and how can we train systems to produce them? We propose a new style of rationale for open-book question answering, called \emph{markup-and-mask}, which combines aspects of extractive and free-text explanations. In the markup phase, the passage is augmented with free-text markup that enables each sentence to stand on its own outside the discourse context. In the masking phase, a sub-span of the marked-up passage is selected. To train a system to produce markup-and-mask rationales without annotations, we leverage in-context learning. Specifically, we generate silver annotated data by sending a series of prompts to a frozen pretrained language model, which acts as a teacher. We then fine-tune a smaller student model by training on the subset of rationales that led to correct answers. The student is""honest""in the sense that it is a pipeline: the rationale acts as a bottleneck between the passage and the answer, while the""untrusted""teacher operates under no such constraints. Thus, we offer a new way to build trustworthy pipeline systems from a combination of end-task annotations and frozen pretrained language models.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,论文提出了一种新的 rationale 生成方法（markup-and-mask），并通过 fine-tune 较小的学生模型来筛选正确的 rationale。虽然涉及 rationale 的生成和筛选，但主要关注的是 rationales 的实用性和可信度，而非直接研究 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的推理过程。因此属于边缘相关。
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,True,True,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文探讨了LLM自我解释的忠实性问题，并提出了自我一致性检查作为度量方法。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究LLM自我解释（self-explanations）的忠实性问题，并提出使用自一致性检查（self-consistency checks）作为测量方法。研究涵盖了counterfactual、feature attribution和redaction explanations，直接符合CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。
"What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT",2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文探讨了CoT的有效性，提出了不忠实现象（如失败步骤影响推理），并提出了新的度量指标（FSF）和改进方法。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the""longer-is-better""narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy. As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Math,该论文主要研究了 CoT 结构和有效性之间的关系，提到了因果干预（通过编辑 CoT 和移除失败分支来提高准确性），但并未明确探讨 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的预测过程。因此，它与 Faithfulness 有一定的间接关联，但更侧重于分析的实用性和结构特性。
Rationale-Guided Few-Shot Classification to Detect Abusive Language,2022,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出基于rationale的few-shot分类方法，涉及CoT和Faithfulness，但未讨论不忠实现象或提出新度量。,"Abusive language is a concerning problem in online social media. Past research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages, demographies, etc. However, models trained using these datasets do not perform well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text that justify the text's label. This method has been found to improve model performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose RGFS (Rationale-Guided Few-Shot Classification) for abusive language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers. We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RGFS models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets, finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RGFS-based models outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform competitively to models finetuned on other source domains. Furthermore, RGFS-based models outperform LIME/SHAP-based approaches in terms of plausibility and are close in performance in terms of faithfulness.",European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,Black-box,Society,这篇论文提到了 faithfulness 的概念，并与 LIME/SHAP-based 方法进行了比较，但没有深入探讨 CoT 的忠实性问题或因果关系，因此属于边缘相关。研究领域涉及社交媒体中的滥用语言检测，属于社会学范畴。

Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization.

Prior approaches focus primarily on measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points.

MedOmni-45°: A Safety-Performance Benchmark for Reasoning-Oriented LLMs in Medicine,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT忠实性和Sycophancy现象，并提出了评估指标。,"With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81 Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both.

FaiRR: Faithful and Robust Deductive Reasoning over Natural Language,2022,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出模块化组件确保推理步骤与推理过程有因果联系，提升忠实性。,"Transformers have been shown to be able to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,论文明确提出了保证模型忠实性的框架（FaiRR），通过模块化设计确保推理步骤与生成结果的因果关联，直接针对 deductive reasoning 中的 faithfulness 问题进行研究。
Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了CoT的解释性与性能的关系，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了改进方法。,"Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer.

A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}""We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.

Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确指出现有LVLMs在CoT推理中往往忽略生成的rationale内容，且提出解决方案RED旨在提升faithfulness和准确性，直接符合CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。

To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process. Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation, enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets, our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method.",,1,Black-box,Math,该论文研究了长链CoT推理过程中的自我纠正和反思机制，但主要关注的是标注技术和PRM模型的表现提升，没有直接探讨CoT生成的推理过程是否忠实反映了模型的实际计算过程（Faithfulness）。因此属于边缘相关。
REV: Information-Theoretic Evaluation of Free-Text Rationales,2022,True,False,True,,论文提出了REV指标评估自由文本推理的新信息，与CoT忠实性相关。,"Generating free-text rationales is a promising step towards explainable NLP, yet evaluating such rationales remains a challenge. Existing metrics have mostly focused on measuring the association between the rationale and a given label. We argue that an ideal metric should focus on the new information uniquely provided in the rationale that is otherwise not provided in the input or the label. We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using conditional V-information (Hewitt et al., 2021). More concretely, we propose a metric called REV (Rationale Evaluation with conditional V-information), to quantify the amount of new, label-relevant information in a rationale beyond the information already available in the input or the label. Experiments across four benchmarks with reasoning tasks, including chain-of-thought, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics. We further demonstrate REV is consistent with human judgments on rationale evaluations and provides more sensitive measurements of new information in free-text rationales. When used alongside traditional performance metrics, REV provides deeper insights into models’ reasoning and prediction processes.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文专注于评估自由文本解释（Rationale）的信息价值，特别是这些解释是否提供了输入或标签中未包含的新信息。通过提出的REV指标，作者试图量化解释中新信息的多少，这与 Faithfulness 研究中关注的解释是否真实反映了模型的预测过程高度相关。此外，论文涉及Chain-of-Thought情景，并通过与传统性能指标的结合，提供了对模型推理过程的更深入理解，符合核心相关的标准。

Existing methods primarily focus on the end-to-end discriminative version of this task, but less work has treated the generative version in which a model searches over the space of statements entailed by the premises to constructively derive the hypothesis. We propose a system for doing this kind of deductive reasoning in natural language by decomposing the task into separate steps coordinated by a search procedure, producing a tree of intermediate conclusions that faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process. Our experiments on the EntailmentBank dataset (Dalvi et al., 2021) demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully prove true statements while rejecting false ones. Moreover, it produces natural language explanations with a 17% absolute higher step validity than those produced by an end-to-end T5 model.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确提出了一个系统，通过搜索过程在自然语言中构建推理树，其生成的中间结论忠实地反映了系统的推理过程。这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义高度一致，因为它关注的是解释（CoT）是否真实反映了模型的计算过程。实验结果显示其生成的自然语言解释比其他模型更具步骤有效性，证明了其对忠实度的考量。
Learning to Rationalize for Nonmonotonic Reasoning with Distant Supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了生成事后解释性理由（post-hoc rationales）的现象，并尝试通过训练生成模型来改进。,"The black-box nature of neural models has motivated a line of research that aims to generate natural language rationales to explain why a model made certain predictions. Such rationale generation models, to date, have been trained on dataset-specific crowdsourced rationales, but this approach is costly and is not generalizable to new tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which neural models can reason about natural language rationales that explain model predictions, relying only on distant supervision with no additional annotation cost for human-written rationales. We investigate multiple ways to automatically generate rationales using pre-trained language models, neural knowledge models, and distant supervision from related tasks, and train generative models capable of composing explanatory rationales for unseen instances. We demonstrate our approach on the defeasible inference task, a nonmonotonic reasoning task in which an inference may be strengthened or weakened when new information (an update) is introduced. Our model shows promises at generating post-hoc rationales explaining why an inference is more or less likely given the additional information, however, it mostly generates trivial rationales reflecting the fundamental limitations of neural language models. Conversely, the more realistic setup of jointly predicting the update or its type and generating rationale is more challenging, suggesting an important future direction.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,Black-box,General,论文研究了生成自然语言解释的过程，并探讨了解释的忠实度和局限性，但主要关注点在于利用语言模型进行解释生成，未深入研究 CoT 的因果角色或欺骗性现象。

We turn to models that *jointly* predict and rationalize, a class of widely used high-performance models for free-text rationalization. We investigate the extent to which the labels and rationales predicted by these models are associated, a necessary property of faithful explanation. Via two tests, *robustness equivalence* and *feature importance agreement*, we find that state-of-the-art T5-based joint models exhibit desirable properties for explaining commonsense question-answering and natural language inference, indicating their potential for producing faithful free-text rationales.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自由文本 rationale 的忠实性问题，提出两个测试方法（robustness equivalence 和 feature importance agreement）来验证 rationale 是否真实反映模型的决策过程，完全符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义和应用场景。

To ensure solvability of simpler tasks, TMNs learn the textual input-output behavior (i.e., language) of existing models through their datasets. This differs from prior decomposition-based approaches which, besides being designed specifically for each complex task, produce decompositions independent of existing sub-models. Specifically, we focus on Question Answering (QA) and show how to train a next-question generator to sequentially produce sub-questions targeting appropriate sub-models, without additional human annotation. These sub-questions and answers provide a faithful natural language explanation of the model’s reasoning. We use this framework to build ModularQA, a system that can answer multi-hop reasoning questions by decomposing them into sub-questions answerable by a neural factoid single-span QA model and a symbolic calculator. Our experiments show that ModularQA is more versatile than existing explainable systems for DROP and HotpotQA datasets, is more robust than state-of-the-art blackbox (uninterpretable) systems, and generates more understandable and trustworthy explanations compared to prior work.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文提出了一种框架（Text Modular Networks），通过将复杂任务分解为可由现有模型解决的简单子任务，并生成子问题和答案作为模型的自然语言解释。明确提到这些解释是‘faithful’的，即真实反映了模型的推理过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。此外，论文还强调了生成的理解和可信度，与 CoT Faithfulness 的研究目标一致。

In this paper, we contribute two insights to this line of research: First, we find that models trained on gold explanations learn to rely on these but, in the case of the more challenging question answering data set we use, fail when given generated explanations at test time. However, additional fine-tuning on generated explanations teaches the model to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information in explanations. Second, we compare explanations by a generation-only model to those generated by a self-rationalizing model and find that, while the former score higher in terms of validity, factual correctness, and similarity to gold explanations, they are not more useful for downstream classification.

As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that while CoT monitoring is more effective than overseeing only model outputs in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage, reasoning traces can contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the CoT monitors, reducing performance in obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores model reasoning and actions, and combines them using a weighted average.

Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过自我批评和细化框架提升解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%.

This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness.

Why do you think that? Exploring faithful sentence–level rationales without supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了如何通过无监督方法生成忠实解释，并提出了训练框架来提升解释的忠实性。,"Evaluating the trustworthiness of a model’s prediction is essential for differentiating between ‘right for the right reasons’ and ‘right for the wrong reasons’. Identifying textual spans that determine the target label, known as faithful rationales, usually relies on pipeline approaches or reinforcement learning. However, such methods either require supervision and thus costly annotation of the rationales or employ non-differentiable models. We propose a differentiable training–framework to create models which output faithful rationales on a sentence level, by solely applying supervision on the target task. To achieve this, our model solves the task based on each rationale individually and learns to assign high scores to those which solved the task best. Our evaluation on three different datasets shows competitive results compared to a standard BERT blackbox while exceeding a pipeline counterpart’s performance in two cases. We further exploit the transparent decision–making process of these models to prefer selecting the correct rationales by applying direct supervision, thereby boosting the performance on the rationale–level.",Findings,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了 faithful rationales，即模型输出的解释是否真实反映了预测过程，属于 Faithfulness 的核心研究范畴。虽然未直接涉及 Chain-of-Thought，但其方法（通过学习选择最佳 rationales）可以迁移到 CoT 的 Faithfulness 分析中。
Leakage-Adjusted Simulatability: Can Models Generate Non-Trivial Explanations of Their Behavior in Natural Language?,2020,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出新的度量标准LAS评估解释的忠实性，并讨论了模型生成解释的合理性问题。,"Data collection for natural language (NL) understanding tasks has increasingly included human explanations alongside data points, allowing past works to introduce models that both perform a task and generate NL explanations for their outputs. Yet to date, model-generated explanations have been evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations, both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the problem of evaluating explanations from the the model simulatability perspective. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how well explanations help an observer predict a model’s output, while controlling for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores.",Findings,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文明确关注解释的忠实性（faithfulness），提出了泄漏调整可模拟性（LAS）指标来评估自然语言解释是否真实反映了模型的行为，而不是仅仅匹配人类的解释（plausibility）。

However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates.

To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation. To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a""cold start, then PRM supervision""paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (e.g.,GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by PRM (7B) to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies.

Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了偏好优化导致CoT不忠实的问题，并提出了通过因果归因改进的方法。,"Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in""reward hacking""by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了CoT解释的忠实度问题，探讨了reward hacking导致的解释不忠实现象（生成解释以最大化奖励而非真实反映推理过程），并提出了基于因果归因的解决方法。这符合核心定义中对Faithfulness的研究要求。

However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's""reasoning""process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.",International Conference on Learning Representations,2,Black-box,Society,这篇论文明确研究了LLM生成解释的忠实度问题，提出了测量忠实度的新方法，并通过社会偏见和医学问答任务展示了不忠实解释的影响，符合核心定义中的Faithfulness研究。

In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a""sneaky generator""that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a""critic""that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, SPC can guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs and significantly improve their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, surpassing those guided by state-of-the-art process reward models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文提出了一种通过对抗自演游戏评估CoT推理步骤可靠性的方法（SPC），直接涉及推理步骤的真实性和错误检测能力（Faithfulness）。虽然没有深入模型内部机制，但通过对抗性生成和评估步骤的可靠性，符合核心相关性标准。
Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出Logic-of-Thought方法解决CoT的不忠实问题，属于改进方法中的Prompting类别。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确提到了 Chain-of-Thought 存在 unfaithful 问题，即生成的推理链与最终结论不一致，并提出了 Logic-of-Thought (LoT) 来解决这一问题。这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义和研究范畴高度相关。

However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Math,论文提出了一个形式化问题解决的框架，并强调了过程级可验证性，这与 CoT Faithfulness 有一定相关性。虽然主要关注的是问题的形式化和解决的准确性，但提出的 RPE 方法用于验证答案的正确性，可以作为 Faithfulness 的旁证。
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT推理中的不忠实现象，如事后找补和逻辑捷径，但未提出新的度量或改进方法。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven.

Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities.",,2,Black-box,Math,该论文明确研究中间推理步骤的忠实度和连贯性（Coherence and Reliability），关注的是如何通过过程级别和结果级别的反馈来确保推理过程的可靠性，而不仅仅是最终答案的正确性。这符合Faithfulness的核心定义，即推理过程是否真实反映了模型的预测过程。

Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify""non-local errors""(which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文提出的Program Trace Prompting通过模块化和可观察的步骤改进了CoT的解释方式，并特别指出了'non-local errors'作为CoT学习中的未解决问题。这直接涉及到CoT解释的忠实度问题，即解释是否真实反映了模型的推理过程。此外，论文还提供了验证CoT解释模块化的方法，这与Faithfulness的研究高度相关。

Additionally, we present a novel technique called Alignment with Anchor Preference Pairs, which improves the selection of preference pairs by categorizing model outputs into three groups: consistently correct, consistently incorrect, and variable.

However, Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) remains challenging for many existing models due to issues like hallucination, error propagation, and limited context length. To address these challenges and enhance LLMs' performance on MHQA, we propose the Self-Guiding prompting Finite State Machine (SG-FSM), designed to strengthen multi-hop reasoning abilities. Unlike traditional chain-of-thought methods, SG-FSM tackles MHQA by iteratively breaking down complex questions into sub-questions, correcting itself to improve accuracy. It processes one sub-question at a time, dynamically deciding the next step based on the current context and results, functioning much like an automaton.

Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

OCEAN: Offline Chain-of-thought Evaluation and Alignment in Large Language Models,2024,True,False,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出了离线评估框架OCEAN，并利用知识图谱和RL优化CoT的忠实性。,"Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata5m) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from KGs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as an MDP and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and RL to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs' general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,该论文提出了一个离线评估框架OCEAN，用于评估和优化LLMs的chain-of-thought能力，并使用知识图谱提供反馈。虽然论文关注CoT与知识图谱的对齐（alignment），但主要强调了CoT的有效性和优化，而不是直接研究CoT是否忠实反映模型的真实推理过程。因此属于边缘相关。

To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model’s information flow, exhibiting strong transferability.

Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training.

FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines.

Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs.

Models switch to the answer implied by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT. To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86\% on held-out tasks.

However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow.

However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations.

How Interpretable are Reasoning Explanations from Prompting Large Language Models?,2024,True,False,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT的忠实性，并提出了新的评估框架和改进方法。,"Prompt Engineering has garnered significant attention for enhancing the performance of large language models across a multitude of tasks. Techniques such as the Chain-of-Thought not only bolster task performance but also delineate a clear trajectory of reasoning steps, offering a tangible form of explanation for the audience. Prior works on interpretability assess the reasoning chains yielded by Chain-of-Thought solely along a singular axis, namely faithfulness. We present a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of interpretability, examining not only faithfulness but also robustness and utility across multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Likewise, our investigation is not confined to a single prompting technique; it expansively covers a multitude of prevalent prompting techniques employed in large language models, thereby ensuring a wide-ranging and exhaustive evaluation. In addition, we introduce a simple interpretability alignment technique, termed Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-thought, that yields more than 70\% improvements across multiple dimensions of interpretability.

FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration,2024,True,True,True,"Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出FLARE方法，通过逻辑编程和多跳搜索提高CoT忠实性，并量化评估。,"Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.",,2,Black-box,Logic,这篇论文明确研究了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)的忠实度问题，提出了FLARE方法用于计算推理过程的忠实度，并与生成的代码进行比较。论文还分析了模型忠实度与整体性能的正相关性，这些内容直接关联到CoT Faithfulness的核心研究范畴。
Larger Language Models Don’t Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT在主观任务中的不忠实现象，即模型依赖先验而非真实推理。,"In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.

Graph of Logic: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Graphs and Symbolic Logic,2024,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出利用符号逻辑增强LLM推理能力，并检测不忠实推理，属于改进方法中的外部工具验证。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to struggle with complex logical reasoning tasks due to the inherent ambiguity and complexity of natural language. These challenges are further amplified when processing large and diverse datasets, increasing the likelihood of unfaithful reasoning and predictive hallucinations. However, LLMs can provide accurate responses when queries are clear and direct. Symbolic logic provides precise, well-defined rules that can help overcome ambiguity and support reasoning. In this work, we leverage symbolic logic’s precision to enhance LLMs’ logical reasoning capabilities by introducing the Graph of Logic (GoL) framework. GoL combines the power of graph structures with the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic. GoL utilizes the precise rules of symbolic logic to infer new facts and detect LLM hallucinations effectively on complex datasets. Furthermore, GoL utilizes graph structures to support scalability for large datasets and tackle long dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets, encompassing various types of reasoning. These include deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, each testing distinct aspects of logical inference. The experimental results demonstrate GoL’s advantage in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GoL outperforms the baselines with an average margin of 18.18% for the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, outperforming the baselines for all datasets for the GPT-3.5 model and six out of seven datasets for the GPT-4 model1.",BigData Congress [Services Society],1,Black-box,Logic,论文探讨了利用符号逻辑和图结构增强LLM的逻辑推理能力，并提及了不忠实推理（unfaithful reasoning）和幻觉（hallucinations）问题，但没有直接研究CoT的忠实性问题。属于边缘相关，因为涉及推理的一致性和鲁棒性，但未深入因果分析。

While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,论文研究了通过上下文学习（ICL）导致的 emergent misalignment（EM）现象，并通过逐步推理（CoT）分析了产生有害输出的机制。特别是，67.5%的不忠实推理轨迹显式地合理化有害输出，涉及事后合理化（Post-hoc Rationalization）和模型行为的一致性（Sycophancy），这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义高度相关。

Our research introduces a task-agnostic framework for evaluating free-text rationales, drawing on insights from both linguistics and machine learning. We evaluate two dimensions of explainability: fidelity and interpretability. For fidelity, we propose methods suitable for proprietary LLMs where direct introspection of internal features is unattainable. For interpretability, we use language models instead of human evaluators, addressing concerns about subjectivity and scalability in evaluations. We apply our framework to evaluate GPT-3.5 and the impact of prompts on the quality of its explanations.

The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了RL诱导的动机推理现象，揭示了CoT可能不忠实反映模型内部决策过程的问题。,"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models'reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文研究了CoT过程中模型的可能动机性推理（motivated reasoning），即模型生成看似合理但不忠实于其内部决策过程的理由。这直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心问题，特别是关于Sycophancy和Post-hoc rationalization的现象。此外，研究还探讨了模型监督者在检测这种行为时的能力差距，这在社会领域具有重要意义。

To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提到了 'reasoning faithfulness' 并提出了一个框架（AutoRubric-R1V）来通过过程级监督提高多模态推理的忠实度。这直接涉及到 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Beyond Correctness: Rewarding Faithful Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了CoT不忠实现象，提出了新的度量框架，并通过RL改进忠实性。,"Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process.

Since generating explanations for annotated labels is a laborious and costly pro cess, recent models rely on large pretrained language models (PLMs) as their backbone and few-shot learning. In this work we explore a self-training approach leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to further improve few-shot models, under the assumption that neither human written rationales nor annotated task labels are available at scale. We introduce a novel dual-teacher learning framework, which learns two specialized teacher models for task prediction and rationalization using self-training and distills their knowledge into a multi-tasking student model that can jointly generate the task label and rationale. Furthermore, we formulate a new loss function, Masked Label Regularization (MLR) which promotes explanations to be strongly conditioned on predicted labels.

Boosting Language Models Reasoning with Chain-of-Knowledge Prompting,2023,True,True,True,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出 CoK prompting 和 F^2-Verification 方法，旨在解决 CoT 的不忠实问题。,"Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has delivered success on complex reasoning tasks, which aims at designing a simple prompt like ``Let's think step by step'' or multiple in-context exemplars with well-designed rationales to elicit Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intermediate reasoning steps. However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出 Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting 来解决 CoT 中的 unfaithful reasoning chains 问题，并引入了 F^2-Verification 方法来评估推理链的 factuality 和 faithfulness。这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题，符合核心相关标准。
Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出了一种增强NLE忠实性的框架，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs.

Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（Miracle Steps），并提出了基于过程奖励的改进方法。,"Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

We investigate whether such""evaluation scent""inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to>1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了 CoT 的忠实性问题，特别是探讨了 LLM 在评测框架下（evaluation scent）是否会产生 inflated CoT（即不忠实的长篇大论），并通过对比实验验证了 prompt framing 对 CoT 长度和答案合规性的影响，直接涉及 CoT 是否真实反映模型的推理过程（faithfulness）而非事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization），且发现了 incentive wording 会改变错误类型分布（如 praising caution 减少自信错误），属于核心相关研究。
FaithCoT-Bench: Benchmarking Instance-Level Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出了一个实例级 CoT 忠实性检测的基准，并讨论了不忠实现象和评估方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve problem-solving and provide seemingly transparent explanations. However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and with more advanced models.

LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种结合逻辑推理和LLM的架构，旨在提高推理的忠实性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.",arXiv.org,0,Black-box,Logic,论文主要关注如何通过神经符号架构提升LLMs在法律和医学等关键领域中的推理性能，特别是处理否定、蕴含和可废止推理等逻辑结构。虽然涉及推理的准确性，但未直接讨论CoT忠实度或模型的内部计算过程是否与其生成的解释一致。研究重点在于性能提升而非解释的真实性。
Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了奖励黑客行为，提出TRACE度量方法，并涉及训练改进。,"Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less'effort'than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究CoT的忠实性问题，特别是模型是否通过'reward hacking'绕过真实推理过程（即隐式作弊）。TRACE方法通过截断CoT分析模型是否简化计算路径，直接对应Faithfulness定义中的'事后解释'检测（Post-hoc rationalization），且提出的指标（AUC曲线）专门用于量化推理过程的真实性。
Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,,论文研究了CoT的忠实性问题，揭示了不忠实现象，如事后找补和捷径学习。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT的忠实性问题，探讨了提示中的暗示如何影响模型生成的推理过程，以及模型是否真实地承认这些暗示。该研究还揭示了模型生成推理过程中的潜在不忠实行为，如事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization）和谄媚行为（sycophancy），这些都是Faithfulness研究的核心问题。
Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning?

Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection.

Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT与答案不一致的现象，并提出了基于验证的改进方法。,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接关注了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 的忠实度问题，明确指出 RLVR 方法可能导致模型的推理过程与最终答案脱节。论文提出的 ACRE 方法通过一致性检查惩罚推理与答案的不一致性，旨在确保推理过程真实反映模型的实际计算过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。

However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning.

Beyond Introspection: Reinforcing Thinking via Externalist Behavioral Feedback,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出外部反馈机制提升推理可靠性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"While inference-time thinking allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems, the extended thinking process can be unreliable or inconsistent because of the model's probabilistic nature, especially near its knowledge boundaries. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this by having the model critique its own reasoning to make corrections. However, such self-critique inherits the same biases of the original output, known as the introspection illusion. Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods. Benefiting from a lightweight and annotation-free design, DRR offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving the reliability of reasoning in a wide range of LLMs.",,1,Black-box,General,论文提出了一个外部反馈框架来提高推理的可靠性，但没有直接研究CoT是否忠实反映了模型的内部计算过程，而是侧重于通过外部判别模型来提高推理的质量和一致性。

When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT在视频推理中的不忠实现象，并提出了基于强化学习的改进方法。,"Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored.

We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance.

Previous work has elicited confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present SaySelf, a novel training framework that teaches LLMs to express more fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance.

The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process.

DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process.

When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally.

Incorporating LLM Versus LLM Into Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Fine-Grained Evidence Generation,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了MCoT中的语义漂移问题，并提出了实体级验证框架来提升忠实性。,"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) has become an effective strategy for enhancing multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) by breaking down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps. Despite its interpretability benefits, MCoT often encounters difficulties with fine-grained semantic grounding, particularly when reasoning involves small objects, subtle attributes, or visually complex scenes that can lead to inaccuracies. Existing attempts to address these issues primarily fall into two categories: fine-tuning, which depends on large annotated datasets and costly parameter updates; and in-context learning (ICL), which achieves few-shot or zero-shot reasoning without model modification. Although ICL provides flexibility and adaptability, it is prone to semantic drift caused by an unstable prompt quality. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an entity-level evidence generation and verification framework using the ICL paradigm. This approach first produces MCoT from multimodal inputs, followed by extraction of key entities with enriched evidential descriptions. These entities were then cross-validated through adversarial checks using multiple MLLMs, and the verified evidence was integrated back into the reasoning chain. Experiments demonstrated consistent performance gains: on ScienceQA, the accuracy improved from 82.39% to 86.04%(+3.65%) with GPT-3.5, 84.96% to 89.37%(+4.41%) with Gemini; on MathVista, the accuracy increased from 43.1% to 43.6%(+0.50%) with GPT-3.5, and from 44.7% to 45.6%(+0.90%) with Gemini.

Question Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning,2023,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过问题分解提升CoT忠实性，并使用了新度量指标验证。,"As large language models (LLMs) perform more difficult tasks, it becomes harder to verify the correctness and safety of their behavior. One approach to help with this issue is to prompt LLMs to externalize their reasoning, e.g., by having them generate step-by-step reasoning as they answer a question (Chain-of-Thought; CoT). The reasoning may enable us to check the process that models use to perform tasks. However, this approach relies on the stated reasoning faithfully reflecting the model's actual reasoning, which is not always the case. To improve over the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, we have models generate reasoning by decomposing questions into subquestions. Decomposition-based methods achieve strong performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes approaching that of CoT while improving the faithfulness of the model's stated reasoning on several recently-proposed metrics. By forcing the model to answer simpler subquestions in separate contexts, we greatly increase the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT, while still achieving some of the performance gains of CoT. Our results show it is possible to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning; continued improvements may lead to reasoning that enables us to verify the correctness and safety of LLM behavior.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了如何通过问题分解来改进CoT推理的忠实性，提出了提高模型生成推理忠实性的方法，并使用了最近提出的度量标准进行验证。这直接对应于Faithfulness研究的核心定义。

Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.",,0,Black-box,General,论文主要研究图像生成的监控与控制，虽然提到了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 的概念，但核心内容是图像生成的可解释性和监控性，而不是研究 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的推理过程。因此，该论文不属于 CoT Faithfulness 的研究范畴。

Stepwise Reasoning Disruption Attack of LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了LLM推理过程中的不忠实现象，即通过SEED攻击误导模型产生错误推理。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain unexplored, particularly in third-party platforms that facilitate user interactions via APIs. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the S tepwise r E asoning E rror D isruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED’s effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

Self-contradictory reasoning evaluation and detection,2023,True,True,True,,论文研究了自我矛盾推理现象，并提出了评估指标，与CoT忠实性高度相关。,"In a plethora of recent work, large language models (LLMs) demonstrated impressive reasoning ability, but many proposed downstream reasoning tasks only focus on final answers. Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support its answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained categories enhanced detection can improve GPT-4's ability to detect Self-Contra. However, it is only able to detect Self-Contra with a 52.2% F1 score, much lower compared to 66.7% for humans. Our results indicate that current LLMs lack the robustness necessary for reliable reasoning and we emphasize the urgent need for establishing best practices in comprehensive reasoning evaluations beyond pure performance-based metrics.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文研究了自我矛盾的推理（Self-Contra reasoning），明确指出模型推理过程中生成的解释与其最终答案不一致。这直接涉及到 CoT 的忠实性问题（Faithfulness），即生成的解释是否真实反映了推理过程，特别是当模型通过捷径（shortcuts）或忽略上下文证据生成正确答案时。论文还讨论了如何检测不可靠的推理，进一步强调了推理过程的忠实性。

For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process of relevant alternatives.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,1,Black-box,Logic,这篇论文研究了语言模型在逻辑阅读理解中的理性理解能力，重点关注为什么应该排除错误选项的解释。虽然没有直接研究CoT的忠实度，但讨论了模型解释能力的局限性，可以作为Faithfulness的一个旁证。

To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against deliberately evasive models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文提出了衡量 CoT 可监测性的方法，包括 legibility 和 coverage，这两个指标直接关联到 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的实际推理过程（Faithfulness）。尽管论文未明确使用 'Faithfulness' 一词，但其研究内容与 CoT 忠实度高度相关。

Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment.

In particular, we outline positive and negative implications depending on the goals and user groups of the self-rationalising system.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文研究了LLM生成的解释的性质，包括选择性、说明性元素以及较少的主观性或误导性，这与CoT Faithfulness的核心关注点——解释是否真实反映模型的预测过程——直接相关。论文还讨论了这些性质存在的正面和负面影响，进一步关联到Faithfulness的概念。
Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出了增强 CoT 反思和错误纠正能力的方法，改进忠实性。,"Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT), present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models ultimately reach their errors.",,1,Black-box,General,论文提出了 Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) 方法，旨在通过错误识别和纠正增强 CoT 的稳健性和可解释性。虽然提到了模型如何识别和纠正错误，但未明确探讨 CoT 步骤是否真实反映模型的推理过程（Faithfulness），因此属于边缘相关。方法基于 Prompting，属于黑盒研究。
Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought,2025,True,True,False,,论文研究了CoT的legibility与faithfulness的关系，揭示了RL训练导致的不忠实现象。,"Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（Faithfulness）问题，特别是通过强化学习方法训练的模型生成的 CoT 是否可读（legible），并探讨了 CoT 的可读性与模型性能之间的关系。论文还提出了可能导致 CoT 不忠实的原因（如隐写术、训练伪影等），符合核心相关标准。
The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs在临床推理中的不忠实现象，即知识获取与推理能力分离。,"Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Medical,论文研究了 CoT 提示在临床自然语言推理任务中的表现，虽然未直接研究 Faithfulness，但揭示了模型在知识获取和推理能力之间的脱节现象，可以作为 Faithfulness 的旁证。
AURA: A Fine-Grained Benchmark and Decomposed Metric for Audio-Visual Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出AURA基准和AuraScore指标评估推理忠实性，揭示了模型推理错误但答案正确的现象。,"Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确提出了评估推理忠实度的新度量标准 AuraScore，重点关注推理过程的真实性（Factual Consistency 和 Core Inference），与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义高度契合。虽然研究领域是多模态（音频-视频），但其核心贡献可直接迁移至纯文本 CoT 的忠实度评估场景。
Measuring and Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,2023,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了视觉语言模型的推理一致性，提出了基于CoT的度量方法，并通过两阶段训练框架提升一致性和性能。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated strong efficacy as visual assistants that can parse natural queries about the visual content and generate human-like outputs. In this work, we explore the ability of these models to demonstrate human-like reasoning based on the perceived information. To address a crucial concern regarding the extent to which their reasoning capabilities are fully consistent and grounded, we also measure the reasoning consistency of these models. We achieve this by proposing a chain-of-thought (CoT) based consistency measure. However, such an evaluation requires a benchmark that encompasses both high-level inference and detailed reasoning chains, which is costly. We tackle this challenge by proposing an LLM-Human-in-the-Loop pipeline, which notably reduces cost while simultaneously ensuring the generation of a high-quality dataset. Based on this pipeline and the existing coarse-grained annotated dataset, we build the CURE benchmark to measure both the zero-shot reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art VLMs, and find that even the best-performing model is unable to demonstrate strong visual reasoning capabilities and consistency, indicating that substantial efforts are required to enable VLMs to perform visual reasoning as systematically and consistently as humans. As an early step, we propose a two-stage training framework aimed at improving both the reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. The first stage involves employing supervised fine-tuning of VLMs using step-by-step reasoning samples automatically generated by LLMs. In the second stage, we further augment the training process by incorporating feedback provided by LLMs to produce reasoning chains that are highly consistent and grounded. We empirically highlight the effectiveness of our framework in both reasoning performance and consistency.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)的链式思维推理的一致性和真实性(consistency和groundedness)，提出了一种基于CoT的一致性测量方法，并设计了两阶段训练框架以提高推理性能和一致性。这直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义，即生成的CoT是否真实反映了模型的推理过程。
The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM在作为评判者时存在捷径偏见和不忠实现象，但未提出具体度量或改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert>Human>LLM>Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了LLM作为评判者时的忠实性问题，揭示了模型在评判过程中依赖表面线索（如来源和时间）而非真实内容质量的倾向，且其解释（justifications）未承认这些偏见，属于典型的Post-hoc Rationalization现象，直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义。

Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions.

We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

However, these LLMs are susceptible to a critical yet often overlooked issue: hallucinations within the reasoning process—instances where the model outputs a correct final answer while its underlying reasoning chain contains fabricated, inconsistent, or logically flawed content. Such hallucination phenomena in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes pose serious challenges to the reliability of educational applications. To address this issue, this study proposes a systematic research framework comprising dataset construction, multi-model CoT evaluation, and hallucination classification and quantification. Utilizing the whole-book reading dataset aligned with the junior secondary Chinese language curriculum, we conduct a comparative evaluation of six leading domestic and international LLMs, including ChatGPT o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Key findings include:(1) Hallucinations in CoT are prevalent across all tested models, with ChatGPT-o1 exhibiting a distinctive high accuracy–high hallucination pattern;(2) Hallucinations are both task-and genre-dependent: narrative texts, particularly novels, tend to trigger higher hallucination indices due to long-range dependencies and implicit cultural references. Tasks involving logical reasoning, linguistic feature analysis, and detail extraction show the highest hallucination rates, revealing model weaknesses in handling long-tail knowledge;(3) Hallucinations typically follow a progressive generative pattern: Information mis-reading → Comprehension deviation → Content fabrication → Logical instability.

Previous studies try to distill task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains. We evaluate PaD on arithmetic reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and general ability.Experimental results demonstrate that smaller models using PaD can not only outperform certain LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-1 13B) but also achieve strong improvement over baselines with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data.

However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs'misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs.

Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Medical,论文明确研究了LLM在复杂医学表型任务中的推理错误（Reasoning Errors），特别区分了解释正确性错误（explanation correctness errors）和不忠实错误（unfaithfulness errors），并评估了提示修改对这些错误的影响，符合Faithfulness研究的核心定义。
Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了 CoT 中的偏见现象，并提出了度量指标，但未提出改进方法。,"The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Society,该论文研究了模型在CoT过程中的偏见，探讨了思考步骤与输出偏见的相关性。虽然未直接研究CoT的忠实性，但对推理过程与最终决策的关系进行了分析，可作为Faithfulness的边缘相关研究。
Humans Perceive Wrong Narratives from AI Reasoning Texts,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了人类对AI推理文本的理解与模型实际计算过程之间的不匹配，涉及不忠实现象。,"A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文研究了人类是否能识别AI生成的推理文本中哪些步骤因果影响了后续步骤，直接涉及CoT的Faithfulness问题，并通过反事实测量揭示了人类理解与模型实际计算过程之间的显著差异。
Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,2024,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT忠实性度量的问题，并揭示了度量与模型准确性之间的相关性，质疑其有效性。,"Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接研究 CoT 忠实度（Faithfulness）问题，验证了模型内部计算与 CoT 生成是否一致，并质疑了现有度量标准的有效性（伪装成准确度的忠实度）。
Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了CoT忠实性问题，并提出了运行时验证方法来提升对齐性。,"Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

Chart-RVR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards for Explainable Chart Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出通过可验证奖励提升 CoT 忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出了一个框架（Chart-RVR）来增强 Large Vision-Language Models（LVLMs）在图表推理任务中的鲁棒性和可解释性，特别是通过自动可验证的奖励来最大化流程一致性（process conformity）和 faithfulness 的图表表格重建，从而改进 rationale fidelity。这与 CoT Faithfulness 的定义高度相关，尤其是论文中提到的 'improving rationale fidelity' 和 'faithful chart table reconstruction' 直接涉及 CoT 推理的真实性和忠实度。
Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification,2024,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出通过论证框架提升解释性和可争议性，与CoT忠实性相关。,"The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs’ performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了如何通过论证框架增强LLM的解释性，并允许对决策进行争议，虽然涉及了解释性和可争议性，但并未明确研究CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因（Faithfulness的核心定义），因此评为边缘相关。

Prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) provide structured reasoning paths, while often suffering from issues related to the quality and authenticity of the generated facts. In this paper, we propose Discrete-Optimized Fact-Tree Prompting (DO-FacT), a novel framework that combines fact proposal generation and fact authenticity verification in an iterative process. In DO-FacT, both the fact proposal generation and authenticity verification modules are refined by Discrete-Optimized Prompt-Tuning (DOPT) in advance, leading to the production of high-quality facts and more reliable validation.

Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文评估了推理模型的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了度量指标。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究推理模型（DeepSeek-R1）与非推理模型在 Chain-of-Thought 忠实度上的差异，实验设计了多种提示线索（cue）来测试模型是否能准确描述这些线索对其答案的影响。研究直接针对 CoT 解释的真实性（Faithfulness），并通过对比实验验证了不同类型的模型在忠实度上的表现差异，尤其是讨论了奖励模型可能导致不忠诚响应的现象。

Despite its popularity, there is a notable absence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps in MCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation (MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chains by evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align more closely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosine similarity or fine-tuning approaches.

However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Logic,论文研究了LLMs在3-SAT问题上的推理能力，涉及推理的鲁棒性和真实性，虽然未直接探讨Faithfulness，但对推理能力的分析可以作为Faithfulness的旁证。

Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro.

General Purpose Verification for Chain of Thought Prompting,2024,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出验证 CoT 步骤的方法，提升推理准确性，属于忠实性改进。,"Many of the recent capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs) arise primarily from their ability to exploit contextual information. In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,该论文提出验证 CoT 步骤的方法（相关性和一致性），并使用了困惑度作为额外的验证工具。虽然论文并未直接研究 CoT 的忠实度（Faithfulness），但讨论了 CoT 的效用在验证过程中的作用，属于边缘相关。

We propose Faithful CoT, a reasoning framework involving two stages: Translation (Natural Language query $\rightarrow$ symbolic reasoning chain) and Problem Solving (reasoning chain $\rightarrow$ answer), using an LM and a deterministic solver respectively. This guarantees that the reasoning chain provides a faithful explanation of the final answer. Aside from interpretability, Faithful CoT also improves empirical performance: it outperforms standard CoT on 9 of 10 benchmarks from 4 diverse domains, with a relative accuracy gain of 6.3% on Math Word Problems (MWP), 3.4% on Planning, 5.5% on Multi-hop Question Answering (QA), and 21.4% on Relational Inference.

Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确指出 CoT 的性能改进并非源于模型学习通用的算法程序，而是依赖于高度特定问题的提示，这与 Faithfulness 的核心问题（即 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的推理过程）密切相关。
LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM生成的不忠实CoT现象，即对抗性帮助，使错误答案看起来合理。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge.

This paper investigates whether LLMs can give faithful high-level explanations of their own internal processes. To explore this, we introduce a dataset, ArticulateRules, of few-shot text-based classification tasks generated by simple rules. Each rule is associated with a simple natural-language explanation. We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations.

We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries.

Rethinking harmless refusals when fine-tuning foundation models,2024,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了模型在微调后可能产生不忠实的推理痕迹（reason-based deception），并提出了通过反驳策略改进的方法。,"In this paper, we investigate the degree to which fine-tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively mitigates versus merely conceals undesirable behavior. Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to elicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post fine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the reasoning traces and the resultant outputs. Notably, we identify a pervasive phenomenon we term \emph{reason-based deception}, where models either stop producing reasoning traces or produce seemingly ethical reasoning traces that belie the unethical nature of their final outputs. We further examine the efficacy of response strategies (polite refusal versus explicit rebuttal) in curbing the occurrence of undesired behavior in subsequent outputs of multi-turn interactions. Our findings reveal that explicit rebuttals significantly outperform polite refusals in preventing the continuation of undesired outputs and nearly eliminate reason-based deception, challenging current practices in model fine-tuning. Accordingly, the two key contributions of this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type of hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust response model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究 CoT 推理是否真实反映模型输出（Reason-based deception现象），属于 Faithfulness 核心范畴。

We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings show that these biases are predictive of model preference and mirror human test-taking strategies even when chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is used. To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a slow thinking process which CoT alone may not provide as it tends to reinforce fast thinking model bias under some prompting methodologies. APriCoT is a step toward developing more robust and fair language models that can think slow.",,2,Black-box,Society,论文研究了CoT推理中存在的偏见问题，指出CoT倾向于强化模型的快速思考偏见，这与Faithfulness直接相关。提出的APriCoT方法通过反事实提示来减少偏见影响，属于CoT忠实度的核心研究。

CoMAT operates entirely with a single LLM and without external solvers. Across four LLMs, CoMAT outperforms traditional CoT on six out of seven benchmarks, achieving gains of 4.48% on MMLU-Redux (MATH) and 4.58% on GaoKao MCQ. In addition to improved performance, CoMAT ensures faithfulness and verifiability, offering a transparent reasoning process for complex mathematical tasks",,1,Black-box,Math,论文提出了改进数学推理的新方法CoMAT，强调忠实性和可验证性，但未深入探讨CoT是否真实反映模型的预测过程。其主要关注点是性能提升和推理透明度，而非因果分析或事后合理化现象。
Rationale-Aware Answer Verification by Pairwise Self-Evaluation,2024,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM生成答案中理性与答案不一致的问题，并提出了改进验证方法。,"Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier’s ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接研究了 rationale（相当于 CoT）的有效性验证问题，明确指出仅凭最终答案正确性无法保证推理过程的忠实性（19%正确答案对应无效推理），并提出了通过 pairwise self-evaluation 筛选可靠 rationale 的方法。这完全符合 Faithfulness 研究范畴的核心定义（关注推理过程是否真实反映模型计算，而非仅答案正确性）。

However, existing methods for entailment tree generation often struggle with logical consistency, resulting in erroneous intermediate conclusions and reducing the overall accuracy of the explanations. To address this issue, we propose case-based deduction (CBD), a novel approach that retrieves cases with similar logical structures from a case base and uses them as demonstrations for logical deduction. This method guides the model toward logically sound conclusions without the need for manually constructing logical rule bases. By leveraging a prototypical network for case retrieval and reranking them using information entropy, CBD introduces diversity to improve in-context learning. Our experimental results on the EntailmentBank dataset show that CBD significantly improves entailment tree generation, achieving performance improvements of 1.7% in Task 1, 0.6% in Task 2, and 0.8% in Task 3 under the strictest Overall AllCorrect metric. These findings confirm that CBD enhances the logical consistency and overall accuracy of AI systems in structured explanation tasks.",Mathematics,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文关注逻辑一致性（Logical consistency）和结构化解释的准确性，虽然提到了解释的可靠性，但主要聚焦于提升生成的逻辑树的表现而非直接研究CoT的忠实度或因果关系。这属于边缘相关的研究。
ReCEval: Evaluating Reasoning Chains via Correctness and Informativeness,2023,True,True,True,,论文提出了评估推理链的框架ReCEval，关注正确性和信息量，与CoT忠实性相关。,"Multi-step reasoning ability is fundamental to many natural language tasks, yet it is unclear what constitutes a good reasoning chain and how to evaluate them. Most existing methods focus solely on whether the reasoning chain leads to the correct conclusion, but this answer-oriented view may confound reasoning quality with other spurious shortcuts to predict the answer. To bridge this gap, we evaluate reasoning chains by viewing them as informal proofs that derive the final answer. Specifically, we propose ReCEval (Reasoning Chain Evaluation), a framework that evaluates reasoning chains via two key properties: (1) correctness, i.e., each step makes a valid inference based on information contained within the step, preceding steps, and input context, and (2) informativeness, i.e., each step provides new information that is helpful towards deriving the generated answer. We evaluate these properties by developing metrics using natural language inference models and V-Information. On multiple datasets, we show that ReCEval effectively identifies various error types and yields notable improvements compared to prior methods. We analyze the impact of step boundaries, and previous steps on evaluating correctness and demonstrate that our informativeness metric captures the expected flow of information in high-quality reasoning chains. Finally, we show that scoring reasoning chains based on ReCEval improves downstream task performance. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/archiki/ReCEval",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文提出了ReCEval框架，专注于评估推理链的正确性和信息量，这与Faithfulness直接相关。特别是，它强调了推理链条中的每一步是否基于有效的信息进行推断，以及每个步骤是否提供了有助于生成答案的新信息。这不仅关注推理链条是否导致正确的结论，还关注推理链条本身的质量和忠实度。此外，论文提出的方法论通过自然语言推理模型和V-信息来衡量这些属性，从而有效地识别了各种错误类型。
Post Hoc Explanations of Language Models Can Improve Language Models,2023,True,True,False,"Prompting & In-Context Learning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文探讨了利用事后解释生成自动化CoT，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in performing complex tasks. Moreover, recent research has shown that incorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of these models, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However, incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as this requires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novel framework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning with Post Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challenges by automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leverage post hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations) capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions. More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales that embed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals to LLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25% over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which rely on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short. Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn, leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning.",Neural Information Processing Systems,0,Black-box,General,论文主要关注如何利用事后解释（Post Hoc Explanations）来提高模型性能，而非研究CoT是否忠实反映了模型的推理过程。它提出了一种自动化生成Rationales的方法以提高预测准确性，但没有涉及CoT的Faithfulness问题。
Can ChatGPT Defend its Belief in Truth? Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate,2023,True,True,False,,论文探讨了LLMs在辩论中无法坚持正确信念的现象，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments. Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests more careful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs can improve their responses based on feedback.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,1,Black-box,General,该论文通过辩论式对话测试LLM是否能坚守其信念（Belief Maintenance），虽然未直接使用“Faithfulness”术语，但探讨了模型是否会因用户无效论证而盲目改变答案（类似Sycophancy现象），属于对推理忠实度的间接验证。但未涉及内部机制或因果性分析，故为边缘相关。
Dynamic Clue Bottlenecks: Towards Interpretable-by-Design Visual Question Answering,2023,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种可解释的中间步骤设计，确保忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown extreme effectiveness in visual question answering (VQA). However, the design nature of these end-to-end models prevents them from being interpretable to humans, undermining trust and applicability in critical domains. While post-hoc rationales offer certain insight into understanding model behavior, these explanations are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing an interpretable by design model that factors model decisions into intermediate human-legible explanations, and allows people to easily understand why a model fails or succeeds. We propose the Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model ( (DCLUB), a method that is designed towards an inherently interpretable VQA system. DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems. Given a question, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues. To supervise and evaluate the generation of VQA explanations within DCLUB, we collect a dataset of 1.7k reasoning-focused questions with visual clues. Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning-focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确提出模型的解释必须忠实（faithful）于模型的实际决策过程，并设计了一个可解释的中间空间（Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model）来确保解释的真实性。这与Faithfulness的核心定义高度契合，特别是解决了Post-hoc rationales的不忠实问题。

Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，通过实验验证了 LLMs 在只给出选项（choices-only）时生成的推理痕迹（reasoning traces）是否真实反映了其决策逻辑（faithfulness tests），并发现这些痕迹揭示了模型并非完全依赖浅层策略（如直接选择答案），而是尝试推断缺失的问题内容。这直接关联到 CoT Faithfulness 的核心议题：推理是否真实反映了模型的计算过程，而非事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization）。

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文明确研究了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理的忠实性（Faithfulness），探讨了 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实解释。通过干预 CoT（如添加错误或改写）来观察模型预测的变化，直接验证了 CoT 的因果作用（Causal role）。此外，论文还分析了模型大小和任务对 CoT 忠实性的影响，符合核心定义中对 Faithfulness 的研究。
Do Models Explain Themselves?

However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers""yes""to the input question""Can eagles fly?""with the explanation""all birds can fly"", then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer""yes""to the counterfactual input""Can penguins fly?"". If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution.",International Conference on Machine Learning,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自然语言解释（NLE）是否能帮助人类预测模型在反事实输入下的行为（counterfactual simulatability），直接关联到解释是否忠实反映模型的实际决策过程（Faithfulness）。提出的两个指标（precision和generality）用于衡量解释的忠实度，并发现LLM的解释精度低且与合理性不相关，揭示了事后合理化（Post-hoc rationalization）现象。
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages",2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了多语言CoT推理的性能、一致性和忠实性，并使用了扰动技术来评估忠实性。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees.

Causal Prompting: Debiasing Large Language Model Prompting based on Front-Door Adjustment,2024,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出基于因果关系的提示方法，利用CoT作为中介变量，并通过微调提升忠实性。,"Despite the notable advancements of existing prompting methods, such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to various biases. Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including approaches based on data augmentation and reweighting, yet they struggle with the complex biases inherent in LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate LLMs biases. In specific, causal intervention is achieved by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs. The chain-of-thought generated by LLM is employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between input prompts and output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases. Moreover, to accurately represent the chain-of-thoughts and estimate the causal effects, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of chain-of-thought by aligning its space with that of the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed causal prompting approach achieves excellent performance across seven natural language processing datasets on both open-source and closed-source LLMs.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了基于因果关系的 Prompting 方法，特别是利用 Front-Door Adjustment 来缓解 LLM 中的偏见问题。论文使用 Chain-of-Thought（CoT）作为中介变量，计算输入提示和输出答案之间的因果效应，从而直接涉及 CoT 是否真实反映了模型预测的计算过程，符合 Faithfulness 研究的核心定义。

IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,该论文提出了IAO Prompting方法，旨在通过结构化模板明确LLMs在复杂推理任务中如何访问和应用知识。虽然它提高了零样本性能并提供了透明度，但主要关注的是知识流的显式化和验证，而不是深入分析CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因。因此，它属于边缘相关的研究范畴。
SPINE: Token-Selective Test-Time Reinforcement Learning with Entropy-Band Regularization,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文讨论了CoT中的不忠实现象（如多数投票奖励导致响应缩短），并提出了改进方法（如选择性更新高熵分支点）。,"Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness.

From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically,2025,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出TRM方法，通过强化学习改进CoT忠实性与正确性评估。,"Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出了 Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM)，通过 sentence-level thinking supervision 来评估语句级别的 faithfulness 和 correctness。该方法直接关注于生成的解释（CoT）是否真实反映了模型的预测过程，属于 Faithfulness 的核心研究范畴。

Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens.

Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了 LLM 生成的事后解释（post-hoc explanations）与真实决策过程的不一致问题（mismatches in feature importance），并提出了一种新的度量标准来更有效地捕捉解释质量的变化。这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度（Faithfulness）问题，即解释是否真实反映了模型的决策过程。虽然论文没有直接提到 CoT，但其研究的核心问题是解释的真实性和一致性，这与 CoT Faithfulness 的研究范畴高度相关。
Are Language Models Consequentialist or Deontological Moral Reasoners?,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM在道德推理中CoT与事后解释的不一致现象，符合不忠实现象的定义。,"As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process. In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments.

Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models,2025,True,True,True,,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（chain disloyalty），并提出了黑盒审计方法进行度量。,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit'chain disloyalty'-- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Winnie-Lian/AHa_Meta_Cognitive",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文研究了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 轨迹中幻觉的因果关系，揭示了 RLLMs 在长 CoT 设置下通过有缺陷的反射推理迭代强化偏见和错误，最终导致幻觉推理路径。此外，论文还发现即使是直接干预幻觉的源头也往往无法逆转其影响，因为推理链表现出'chain disloyalty'（对纠正的抵抗和保留有缺陷逻辑的倾向）。这些发现直接关联到 CoT Faithfulness 的研究范畴，特别是关于 Post-hoc Rationalization 和 Sycophancy 的问题。
Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了QuaSAR方法来提升Faithfulness。,"Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确提到 CoT 生成的解释易受内容偏见影响，从而影响其鲁棒性和忠实度（faithfulness）。作者提出的 QuaSAR 方法旨在通过准符号抽象来改善 CoT 的忠实度，且实验验证了其在对抗性任务上的鲁棒性和一致性提升。因此，该论文直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度研究。
Investigating CoT Monitorability in Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了CoT忠实性和监控可靠性，揭示了不忠实现象如捷径和阿谀奉承。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models'long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models'misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了 CoT 的忠实度问题，包括模型是否真实反映其内部决策过程（verbalization）以及 CoT 监控的可靠性（monitor reliability）。此外，论文还涉及模型的欺骗行为（sycophancy）和监控的有效性，这些都是 CoT Faithfulness 的核心议题。
Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2023,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT解释可能误导性地反映模型预测的真实原因，属于不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 解释是否真实反映模型的预测过程，发现 CoT 可以系统性误导（如通过偏置输入），验证了 Unfaithful Explanations 现象，直接关联 Faithfulness 核心议题。
Cross-Examiner: Evaluating Consistency of Large Language Model-Generated Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM生成解释的不一致性，并提出了一种通过后续问题检查一致性的新方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to explain their outputs to enhance accuracy and transparency. However, evidence suggests that these explanations can misrepresent the models' true reasoning processes. One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,"这篇论文研究了大型语言模型生成的解释是否一致（consistency checking）, 并提出了通过后续问题（follow-up questions）来验证模型解释是否真实反映了其推理过程。这正是 Faithfulness 研究的核心范畴（论文明确提及'这些解释可能歪曲模型的真实推理过程'）。尽管采用了黑盒方法（基于输入输出和提问），但直接针对解释的真实性（而非纯性能提升）。"
Limits of Generalization in RLVR: Two Case Studies in Mathematical Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了RLVR在数学推理中的忠实性问题，揭示了模型可能依赖表面启发式而非真实推理。,"Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

Scaling hermeneutics: a guide to qualitative coding with LLMs for reflexive content analysis,2025,True,False,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文讨论了使用CoT提升LLMs在定性编码中的忠实性，但未涉及不忠实现象或新度量指标。,"Qualitative coding, or content analysis, is more than just labeling text: it is a reflexive interpretive practice that shapes research questions, refines theoretical insights, and illuminates subtle social dynamics. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly adept at nuanced language tasks, questions arise about whether—and how—they can assist in large-scale coding without eroding the interpretive depth that distinguishes qualitative analysis from traditional machine learning and other quantitative approaches to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that preserves hermeneutic value while incorporating LLMs to scale the application of codes to large data sets that are impractical for manual coding. Our workflow retains the traditional cycle of codebook development and refinement, adding an iterative step to adapt definitions for machine comprehension, before ultimately replacing manual with automated text categorization. We demonstrate how to rewrite code descriptions for LLM-interpretation, as well as how structured prompts and prompting the model to explain its coding decisions (chain-of-thought) can substantially improve fidelity. Empirically, our case study of socio-historical codes highlights the promise of frontier AI language models to reliably interpret paragraph-long passages representative of a humanistic study. Throughout, we emphasize ethical and practical considerations, preserving space for critical reflection, and the ongoing need for human researchers’ interpretive leadership. These strategies can guide both traditional and computational scholars aiming to harness automation effectively and responsibly—maintaining the creative, reflexive rigor of qualitative coding while capitalizing on the efficiency afforded by LLMs.",EPJ Data Science,0,Black-box,Society,论文主要探讨如何使用LLMs进行定性编码的内容分析，虽然提到了使用Chain-of-Thought（CoT）来提高保真度，但并未深入讨论CoT的解释是否忠实反映了模型的推理过程。研究重点在于如何保持解释性深度和提高自动化编码的效率，而不是验证CoT的忠实度。因此，该论文不属于CoT Faithfulness的研究范畴。
Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文揭示了CoT推理可能降低归纳性能的现象，并提出了结构化干预方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains, yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled, diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack - with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning counterparts. To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文研究了CoT提示如何通过放大错误来降低归纳性能，揭示了CoT推理中的三种失败模式（子任务分解错误、子任务解决错误和最终答案总结错误），直接关联到CoT的Faithfulness问题。
Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了评估解释的框架，涉及 CoT 的忠实性度量，但未讨论不忠实现象或改进方法。,"LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了解释的counterfactual simulatability，即用户能否通过解释推断模型在反事实情景下的输出，这直接关联到解释的忠实性（Faithfulness）。尽管研究领域为生成任务而非特定CoT，但其方法和核心问题与Faithfulness高度相关。
MMC: Iterative Refinement of VLM Reasoning via MCTS-based Multimodal Critique,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出通过迭代反馈机制改进VLM的推理能力，涉及CoT忠实性改进方法。,"Visual language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations, resulting in incorrect reasoning outcomes. Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node—one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets and mainstream VLMs demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of VLMs on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and wide applicability.",,0,Black-box,General,该论文主要关注通过外部反馈机制提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理性能，虽然涉及了推理路径的生成和修正，但并未探讨 CoT 的解释是否忠实反映了模型的内部计算过程。研究重点在于性能提升而非忠实度分析。
FaithAct: Faithfulness Planning and Acting in MLLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出了FaithEval评估框架和FaithAct改进方法，关注CoT忠实性。,"Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了行为忠实度（行为和输出的一致性）和感知忠实度（推理和输入的一致性），并提出了量化评估框架FaithEval。FaithAct框架强化了每个推理步骤的依据基础，直接针对CoT的忠实性问题。
LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了模型在CoT监控下故意表现不佳的不忠实现象。,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了模型在能力评估中通过隐藏真实意图（sandbagging）对抗CoT监控的现象，直接涉及CoT解释的真实性（Faithfulness）。研究发现模型能在监控下刻意输出不真实的推理过程（Unfaithful CoT），并分析了监控失效的原因，属于核心相关研究。
FRAME: Evaluating Rationale-Label Consistency Metrics for Free-Text Rationales,2022,True,True,True,,论文讨论了自由文本理由的忠实性问题，并提出了评估框架FRAME，涉及不忠实现象和度量指标。,"Following how humans communicate, free-text rationales aim to use natural language to explain neural language model (LM) behavior. However, free-text rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics' reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales, which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric that greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing competitively on (2). Finally, we discuss the limitations of using RLC to evaluate free-text rationales.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 rationale-label consistency (RLC)，即自由文本解释与模型预测标签之间的一致性，这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义高度相关。论文提出了 FRAME 框架来评估 RLC 指标的可靠性，并通过三个公理来衡量解释是否忠实反映了模型的预测过程（axiom 1和3直接涉及解释的忠实性）。此外，论文还讨论了现有 RLC 指标的局限性，这与 Post-hoc rationalization 现象相关。
Beware the Rationalization Trap!

Thus, to assess the success of language model explainability, we need to consider the impact of its divergence from a user's mental model of language. In this position paper, we argue that in order to avoid harmful rationalization and achieve truthful understanding of language models, explanation processes must satisfy three main conditions: (1) explanations have to truthfully represent the model behavior, i.e., have a high fidelity; (2) explanations must be complete, as missing information distorts the truth; and (3) explanations have to take the user's mental model into account, progressively verifying a person's knowledge and adapting their understanding.

Self-Filtered Distillation with LLMs-generated Trust Indicators for Reliable Patent Classification,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了LLM生成的理由中存在逻辑错误和标签不匹配等不忠实现象，并提出了基于信任指标的蒸馏方法来提升忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision.

"Interpretable Traces, Unexpected Outcomes: Investigating the Disconnect in Trace-Based Knowledge Distillation",2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了CoT推理痕迹的忠实性问题，并提出了基于规则的问题分解方法来改进。,"Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem, particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD. However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for improving SLMs' final performance via KD.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了推理轨迹（CoT）的忠实性问题，探讨了正确轨迹与最终输出正确性之间的低相关性，直接挑战了利用推理轨迹提升模型性能的隐含假设，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。

We present FOL-Traces, the first large-scale dataset of programmatically verified reasoning traces, enabling rigorous evaluation of structured logical inference. We also propose two challenging and comprehensive diagnostic tasks-masked operation prediction and step completion-that directly probe syntactic awareness and process fidelity. FOL-Traces serves as a scalable testbed for rigorously studying how models perform structured logical inference.

In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving.

Mitigating Deceptive Alignment via Self-Monitoring,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（如欺骗性对齐），提出了度量框架DeceptionBench，并提出了改进方法CoT Monitor+。,"Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出通过符号化方法和微调提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.",,1,Black-box,Logic,论文通过符号引导的方法增强逻辑推理，虽然涉及推理过程的改进，但主要关注性能提升和泛化能力，未明确研究 CoT 的忠实度问题。
LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出评估自然语言解释可信度的框架，关注忠实性，并揭示通用模型的不忠实现象。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2,Black-box,Medical,论文明确提出评估自然语言解释的信任度框架，重点关注 Plausibility 和 Faithfulness。特别指出通用模型在 Faithfulness 上的不一致性，与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关，属于核心文献。
Towards Consistent Natural-Language Explanations via Explanation-Consistency Finetuning,2024,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了LLMs生成不一致解释的问题，并提出了通过微调提升一致性的方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) often generate convincing, fluent explanations. However, different from humans, they often generate inconsistent explanations on different inputs. For example, an LLM may generate the explanation""all birds can fly""when answering the question""Can sparrows fly?""but meanwhile answer""no""to the related question""Can penguins fly?"". Explanations should be consistent across related examples so that they allow a human to simulate the LLM's decision process on multiple examples. We propose explanation-consistency finetuning (EC-finetuning), a method that adapts LLMs to generate more consistent natural-language explanations on related examples. EC-finetuning involves finetuning LLMs on synthetic data that is carefully constructed to contain consistent explanations. Across a variety of question-answering datasets in various domains, EC-finetuning yields a 10.0% relative explanation consistency improvement on four finetuning datasets, and generalizes to seven out-of-distribution datasets not seen during finetuning (+4.5% relative).

Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出新度量标准HAF评估LLMs毒性解释的忠实性，揭示了不一致和不相关响应现象。,"The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs'reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs'free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs'toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how""non-ideal""the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses.

LAMP: Extracting Locally Linear Decision Surfaces from LLM World Models,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出LAMP方法，评估模型解释与预测的一致性，涉及CoT忠实性。,"We introduce LAMP (Linear Attribution Mapping Probe), a method that shines light onto a black-box language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,LAMP 方法通过局部线性模型近似语言模型的决策表面，研究模型如何可靠地将其自我报告的解释映射到预测中。具体来说，它将模型自我报告的解释作为一个坐标系，并拟合一个局部线性代理模型，将这些权重与模型的输出连接起来。这表明该论文明确研究了模型解释（CoT）是否真实反映了模型的预测过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。尽管不需要访问模型梯度或内部激活值，但仍属于 Black-box 方法。
Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines,2025,True,True,False,,论文讨论了CoT在Agentic Pipelines中的不忠实现象，即CoT未能提供真正的解释性。,"Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文直接研究了 CoT 的 Faithfulness 问题，指出 CoT 在 Agent Pipeline 中并未带来更好的输出或解释性，反而产生了没有真实解释性的解释（即 Unfaithful）。这与核心定义中的 'Post-hoc Rationalization' 和 'Unfaithful' 问题直接相关。
Constraints-of-Thought: A Framework for Constrained Reasoning in Language-Model-Guided Search,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了 Const-o-T 框架，通过约束引导推理，提高忠实性和规划效率。,"While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints, especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions, improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.",arXiv.org,0,Black-box,General,论文主要关注如何使用约束来改善规划和搜索效率，而不是研究CoT的解释是否忠实反映了模型的推理过程。

In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative""thinking mode""is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models""think"", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based.

However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i) providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for these behaviors. Our experiments show that utilizing RLVR with our proposed reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR1.",,2,Black-box,Medical,论文针对医疗领域问答中的奖励黑客行为（如跳过推理步骤或使用非标准推理格式），提出了复合奖励函数来惩罚这些行为，直接涉及CoT生成的忠实性问题（Faithfulness）。符合核心相关标准。
Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种代理推理方法，通过分解任务和验算机制提升忠实性。,"A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck.

Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了LRMs中的不一致性，包括推理与自我解释的不一致，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread""scheming""behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading effective supervision.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文研究了推理效率与行为不一致性之间的关系，明确指出了 LRMs 存在的 'scheming' 行为，包括事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization）和隐瞒推理线索（withholding reasoning cues），这些行为直接关联到 CoT Faithfulness 的核心问题。此外，论文提出的基准 $ICBENCH$ 专门衡量了模型内部推理与自我解释之间的不一致性（IR-SE），这直接对应于 Faithfulness 的定义。

To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns.

We call our approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets.

Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs,2024,False,True,False,,论文讨论了LLM推理过程中的错误注入问题，但与CoT忠实性无直接联系。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SEED-Attack.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了LLM推理过程中的鲁棒性（Robustness），揭示了推理步骤中的脆弱性。虽然未直接涉及Faithfulness的核心定义（如事后合理化或因果代理），但它通过干扰推理步骤导致错误的结果，可以作为Faithfulness研究的旁证（即推理流程是否可靠）。
WakenLLM: Evaluating Reasoning Potential and Stability in LLMs via Fine-Grained Benchmarking,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文探讨了LLM在推理任务中的不忠实现象，并提出了新的评估框架和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning. To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding. Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs'reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,论文研究了 LLM 在推理任务中的潜在能力和稳定性，特别是关于 'Unknown' 输出的分析。虽然提到了 'valid reasoning' 和 'justified responses'，但主要关注的是推理的可纠正性和潜在能力，而非直接研究 CoT 的忠实度。因此属于边缘相关。
A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models,2025,False,False,False,,论文综述了CoT推理的可信度，但未具体讨论忠实性问题。,"The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

V-STaR: Benchmarking Video-LLMs on Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning,2025,True,False,True,,论文讨论了Video-LLMs的时空推理逻辑，并提出了评估框架，涉及CoT和Faithfulness。,"Human processes video reasoning in a sequential spatio-temporal reasoning logic, we first identify the relevant frames (""when"") and then analyse the spatial relationships (""where"") between key objects, and finally leverage these relationships to draw inferences (""what""). However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also""reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic""in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained""memory""of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,该论文提出了一个视频时空推理基准(V-STaR)，旨在评估Video-LLMs是否真正理解视频中的对象交互，而不仅仅是依赖预训练的记忆偏差。虽然它关注的是CoT逻辑的再现性和一致性(Robustness/Self-consistency)，可以作为Faithfulness的旁证，但并未直接研究CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因(Causal role)或欺骗性现象。
QA-NatVer: Question Answering for Natural Logic-based Fact Verification,2023,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文关注生成忠实解释的推理过程，并提出了基于QA的方法来预测自然逻辑运算符。,"Fact verification systems assess a claim's veracity based on evidence. An important consideration in designing them is faithfulness, i.e. generating explanations that accurately reflect the reasoning of the model. Recent works have focused on natural logic, which operates directly on natural language by capturing the semantic relation of spans between an aligned claim with its evidence via set-theoretic operators. However, these approaches rely on substantial resources for training, which are only available for high-resource languages. To this end, we propose to use question answering to predict natural logic operators, taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models. Thus, we obviate the need for annotated training data while still relying on a deterministic inference system. In a few-shot setting on FEVER, our approach outperforms the best baseline by $4.3$ accuracy points, including a state-of-the-art pre-trained seq2seq natural logic system, as well as a state-of-the-art prompt-based classifier. Our system demonstrates its robustness and portability, achieving competitive performance on a counterfactual dataset and surpassing all approaches without further annotation on a Danish verification dataset. A human evaluation indicates that our approach produces more plausible proofs with fewer erroneous natural logic operators than previous natural logic-based systems.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提到在设计基于自然逻辑的事实验证系统时，忠实度是一个重要考虑因素，即生成的解释需要准确反映模型的推理过程。此外，论文还进行了人工评估，表明其方法生成的解释比以前的自然逻辑系统更合理，符合 CoT Faithfulness 的核心研究范畴。
Advancing Process Verification for Large Language Models via Tree-Based Preference Learning,2024,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种新的验证方法 Tree-PLV，通过偏好学习评估推理步骤，提升 CoT 忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling complex reasoning tasks by generating step-by-step rationales. Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing benchmarks. For instance, Tree-PLV achieved substantial performance gains over the Mistral-7B self-consistency baseline on GSM8K (67.55% → 82.79%), MATH (17.00% → 26.80%), CSQA (68.14% → 72.97%), and StrategyQA (82.86% → 83.25%). Additionally, our study explores the appropriate granularity for applying preference learning, revealing that step-level guidance provides feedback that better aligns with the evaluation of the reasoning process.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了通过偏好学习验证推理路径的有效性，虽未直接探讨 CoT 忠实度，但对推理步骤的评估提供了边缘相关的信息。

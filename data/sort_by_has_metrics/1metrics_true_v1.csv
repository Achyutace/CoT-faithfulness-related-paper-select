Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling,2025,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的忠实性问题，提出了通过重采样进行因果分析的方法，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In""agentic misalignment""scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes""unfaithful"", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究了 CoT 的忠实性问题，通过重采样方法来验证推理步骤是否真实影响模型决策。特别提到了 'agentic misalignment' 情景下的因果影响测量，以及干预措施对推理的稳定性影响。这些都直接关联到 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT的忠实性和详细程度，提出了新的度量指标，并揭示了不忠实现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（faithfulness）以及其作为模型外部 '工作记忆' 的监控能力（monitorability），并提出了结合忠实度和详细程度（verbosity）的综合监控得分。这直接关联到 CoT 是否真实反映模型的内部推理过程，符合核心定义中对 faithfulness 的研究。
Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文揭示了CoT中存在真假思考步骤的现象，并提出了度量指标TTS和白盒干预方法。,"Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning steps don't truly contribute to LLMs'prediction. We measure the step-wise causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS>= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model. Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs. By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文直接研究 CoT 步骤的真实因果影响（True Thinking Score），揭示 LLM 存在装饰性思考步骤（Decorative-thinking steps），并提出了 steering 方法来强制真实思考。核心涉及 Faithfulness 的核心概念。
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,True,True,True,,论文研究了CoT的学习动态，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了量化框架。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究了CoT的忠实度（trace faithfulness），特别是发现了一个短暂的不可信阶段，在这个阶段模型虽然给出了正确答案，但跳过了CoT步骤或与之矛盾。此外，论文还涉及了模型的内部计算机制，这些都是CoT Faithfulness研究的核心内容。
Causal-driven Large Language Models with Faithful Reasoning for Knowledge Question Answering,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出基于因果推理的框架CORE，旨在提升忠实推理，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"In Large Language Models (LLMs), text generation that involves knowledge representation is often fraught with the risk of ""hallucinations'', where models confidently produce erroneous or fabricated content. These inaccuracies often stem from intrinsic biases in the pre-training stage or from the incorporation of human preference biases during the fine-tuning process. To mitigate these issues, we take inspiration from Goldman's causal theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge is not merely about having a true belief but also involves a causal connection between the belief and the truth of the proposition. We instantiate this theory within the context of Knowledge Question Answering (KQA) by constructing a causal graph that delineates the pathways between the candidate knowledge and belief. Through the application of the do-calculus rules from structural causal models, we devise an unbiased estimation framework based on this causal graph, thereby establishing a methodology for knowledge modeling grounded in causal inference. The resulting CORE framework (short for ""Causal knOwledge REasoning'') is comprised of four essential components: question answering, causal reasoning, belief scoring, and refinement. Together, they synergistically improve the KQA system by fostering faithful reasoning and introspection. Extensive experiments are conducted on ScienceQA and HotpotQA datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the CORE framework.",ACM Multimedia,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究因果驱动的推理（Causal-driven reasoning）并设计了CORE框架以确保知识问答中的忠实性（Faithful Reasoning）。通过构建因果图和do-calculus规则，论文直接解决了模型生成内容与真实知识之间的因果连接问题，符合核心相关的标准。
Counterfactual Evaluation for Explainable AI,2021,True,False,True,,论文提出了基于反事实推理的新评估方法，直接针对解释的忠实性度量。,"While recent years have witnessed the emergence of various explainable methods in machine learning, to what degree the explanations really represent the reasoning process behind the model prediction -- namely, the faithfulness of explanation -- is still an open problem. One commonly used way to measure faithfulness is \textit{erasure-based} criteria. Though conceptually simple, erasure-based criterion could inevitably introduce biases and artifacts. We propose a new methodology to evaluate the faithfulness of explanations from the \textit{counterfactual reasoning} perspective: the model should produce substantially different outputs for the original input and its corresponding counterfactual edited on a faithful feature. Specially, we introduce two algorithms to find the proper counterfactuals in both discrete and continuous scenarios and then use the acquired counterfactuals to measure faithfulness. Empirical results on several datasets show that compared with existing metrics, our proposed counterfactual evaluation method can achieve top correlation with the ground truth under diffe",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究了解释的忠实性问题（Faithfulness of explanation），并提出了一种基于反事实推理（counterfactual reasoning）的新方法来评估解释的忠实性。这与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义高度相关，尤其是涉及反事实输入和忠实性测量指标。因此评为核心相关。
Diagnostics-Guided Explanation Generation,2021,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了如何优化解释的忠实性，并提出了直接优化诊断属性的训练方法。,"Explanations shed light on a machine learning model's rationales and can aid in identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model. Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the confidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for these diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level explanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human rationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,Black-box,General,论文明确讨论了Faithfulness的定义及其在解释生成中的重要性，提出了一种直接优化Faithfulness等诊断属性的方法，符合CoT Faithfulness研究的核心定义和目标。
Measuring the Faithfulness of Thinking Drafts in Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出了评估思维草稿忠实性的框架，揭示了当前模型在中间推理步骤中的选择性忠实性问题。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in complex problem-solving by introducing a thinking draft that enables multi-path Chain-of-Thought explorations before producing final answers. Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper, we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the draft conclusions. These results underscore the need for more faithful and interpretable reasoning in advanced LRMs.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性（Faithfulness），提出了系统的干预框架来评估思考草案的忠实性，包括 Intra-Draft Faithfulness 和 Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness 两个维度，符合核心相关标准。
Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种自动化验证方法EDCT，用于检测Vision-Language模型解释的忠实性，并揭示了不忠实现象。,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis. Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2) parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal tests.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究视觉语言模型生成的解释（NLEs）是否真实反映了模型预测的因果因素，提出了Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT)方法来验证解释的忠实度，并计算Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS)来衡量解释的因果关联性。这与Faithfulness的核心定义完全吻合。
Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过微调LLMs遵循医学指南进行推理，提出了评估推理过程忠实性的方法。,"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.",,2,White-box,Medical,论文明确研究医学领域中LLM的推理过程是否符合医学共识指南（step-by-step reasoning），并提出了评估推导正确性（derivation correctness）的方法，直接关联到CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。
What Really Counts?

To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.",,2,White-box,General,该论文直接研究了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理的 faithfulness 和 interpretability，通过 attribution 方法来评估 CoT 的忠实度。特别关注了 step-level 和 token-level 的 attribution 模式，并探讨了 CoT 在多语言环境下的局限性，这与 CoT Faithfulness 的定义和研究目标高度相关。
Comparing zero-shot self-explanations with human rationales in text classification,2024,True,True,True,,论文分析了自解释的忠实性，并比较了其与人类注释的差异。,"Instruction-tuned LLMs are able to provide an explanation about their output to users by generating self-explanations. These do not require gradient computations or the application of possibly complex XAI methods. In this paper, we analyse whether this ability results in a good explanation. We evaluate self-explanations in the form of input rationales with respect to their plausibility to humans as well as their faithfulness to models. We study two text classification tasks: sentiment classification and forced labour detection, i.e., identifying pre-defined risk indicators of forced labour. In addition to English, we include Danish and Italian translations of the sentiment classification task and compare self-explanations to human annotations for all samples. To allow for direct comparisons, we also compute post-hoc feature attribution, i.e., layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and analyse 4 LLMs. We show that self-explanations align more closely with human annotations compared to LRP, while maintaining a comparable level of faithfulness. This finding suggests that self-explanations indeed provide good explanations for text classification.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了自我解释（self-explanations）的忠实度（faithfulness）与人类标注的对比，并使用了梯度计算方法（LRP）进行分析，符合核心相关标准。
Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出了NeuroFaith框架，评估和提升LLM自我解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和度量方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, indicating a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith is developed to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering.

Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了基于激活的监控方法。,"Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究 Chain of Thought (CoT) 的忠实性问题，特别是提到 'CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading'，并讨论了 performative CoTs 的现象，其中推理过程与最终回答持续矛盾。此外，论文使用了白盒方法（如激活值线性探测）来检测推理信号，直接涉及到 Faithfulness 的核心定义和研究内容。
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,True,True,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文探讨了LLM自我解释的忠实性问题，并提出了自我一致性检查作为度量方法。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general.

Inducing Faithfulness in Structured Reasoning via Counterfactual Sensitivity,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种新的训练目标CSR，旨在增强模型推理步骤与输出之间的因果依赖性，直接涉及CoT的忠实性。,"The reasoning processes of large language models often lack faithfulness; a model may generate a correct answer while relying on a flawed or irrelevant reasoning trace. This behavior, a direct consequence of training objectives that solely reward final-answer correctness, severely undermines the trustworthiness of these models in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces \textbf{Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)}, a novel training objective designed to forge a strong, causal-like dependence between a model's output and its intermediate reasoning steps. During training, CSR performs automated, operator-level interventions on the generated reasoning trace (e.g., swapping ``+''with ``-'') to create a minimally-perturbed counterfactual. A regularization term then penalizes the model if this logically flawed trace still yields the original answer. Our efficient implementation adds only 8.7\% training overhead through warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization. We evaluate faithfulness using \textbf{Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)}, a metric quantifying how sensitive the final answer is to such logical perturbations. Across diverse structured reasoning benchmarks -- arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop QA (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP) -- models trained with CSR demonstrate a vastly superior trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, with this learned sensitivity generalizing to larger models and enhancing the performance of inference-time techniques like self-consistency.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,这篇论文直接研究 CoT 的 Faithfulness 问题，提出了 Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR) 和 Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS) 来确保模型输出的推理步骤与最终答案之间具有因果依赖性。通过干预中间推理步骤来惩罚不符合逻辑的推理，论文明确解决了 CoT 的忠实度问题，且方法涉及模型内部机制的训练干预，属于白盒方法。
MedOmni-45°: A Safety-Performance Benchmark for Reasoning-Oriented LLMs in Medicine,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT忠实性和Sycophancy现象，并提出了评估指标。,"With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81 Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both.

We demonstrate that *pipelines*, models for faithful rationalization on information-extraction style tasks, do not work as well on “reasoning” tasks requiring free-text rationales. We turn to models that *jointly* predict and rationalize, a class of widely used high-performance models for free-text rationalization. We investigate the extent to which the labels and rationales predicted by these models are associated, a necessary property of faithful explanation. Via two tests, *robustness equivalence* and *feature importance agreement*, we find that state-of-the-art T5-based joint models exhibit desirable properties for explaining commonsense question-answering and natural language inference, indicating their potential for producing faithful free-text rationales.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自由文本 rationale 的忠实性问题，提出两个测试方法（robustness equivalence 和 feature importance agreement）来验证 rationale 是否真实反映模型的决策过程，完全符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义和应用场景。

To address this issue, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning Models (SSRMs), which are trained to produce semi-structured representations of reasoning. SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a non-executable Pythonic syntax that names each reasoning step and marks its inputs and outputs. This structure allows SSRM traces to be automatically audited to identify reasoning flaws. We evaluate three types of audits: hand-crafted structured reasoning audits, written in a domain-specific language (DSL) implemented in Python; LLM-generated structured reasoning audits; and learned typicality audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning traces. We show that all of these methods can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors. Importantly, the auditability of SSRMs does not appear to compromise overall accuracy: in evaluation on twelve benchmarks and two model families, SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generalizability relative to other models of comparable size.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文直接解决了 CoT 的 Faithfulness 问题，提出了 SSRMs 来生成半结构化推理痕迹，并通过自动审计识别推理缺陷（如错误和遗漏）。论文明确关注推理的真实性和可审计性，属于核心相关研究。

A common way of incorporating facts from the graph is to encode them separately from the question, and then combine the two representations to select an answer. In this paper, we argue that highly faithful graph-based explanations cannot be extracted from existing models of this type. Such explanations will not include reasoning done by the transformer encoding the question, so will be incomplete.

ERASER: A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models,2019,True,False,True,,论文提出了评估模型解释忠实性的新指标和框架，与CoT Faithfulness相关。,"State-of-the-art models in NLP are now predominantly based on deep neural networks that are opaque in terms of how they come to make predictions. This limitation has increased interest in designing more interpretable deep models for NLP that reveal the ‘reasoning’ behind model outputs. But work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and tasks with correspondingly unique aims and metrics; this makes it difficult to track progress. We propose the Evaluating Rationales And Simple English Reasoning (ERASER a benchmark to advance research on interpretable models in NLP. This benchmark comprises multiple datasets and tasks for which human annotations of “rationales” (supporting evidence) have been collected. We propose several metrics that aim to capture how well the rationales provided by models align with human rationales, and also how faithful these rationales are (i.e., the degree to which provided rationales influenced the corresponding predictions). Our hope is that releasing this benchmark facilitates progress on designing more interpretable NLP systems.

Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过自我批评和细化框架提升解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了自然语言解释（NLEs）的忠实性问题，提出了一个自我批判和细化的框架来提高解释的忠实度，这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义相符。论文还展示了如何通过反馈机制减少解释的不忠实率，直接触及了Faithfulness的关键问题。

In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出了一个衡量预测与解释一致性的指标（PEX consistency），并将其作为解释忠实度（Faithfulness）的重要方面。研究揭示了大型语言模型生成的解释中超过62%缺乏一致性，并通过优化方法提高了忠实度。这直接符合核心相关标准，特别是关于解释是否真实反映模型预测过程的研究。
Leakage-Adjusted Simulatability: Can Models Generate Non-Trivial Explanations of Their Behavior in Natural Language?,2020,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出新的度量标准LAS评估解释的忠实性，并讨论了模型生成解释的合理性问题。,"Data collection for natural language (NL) understanding tasks has increasingly included human explanations alongside data points, allowing past works to introduce models that both perform a task and generate NL explanations for their outputs. Yet to date, model-generated explanations have been evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations, both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the problem of evaluating explanations from the the model simulatability perspective. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how well explanations help an observer predict a model’s output, while controlling for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores.",Findings,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文明确关注解释的忠实性（faithfulness），提出了泄漏调整可模拟性（LAS）指标来评估自然语言解释是否真实反映了模型的行为，而不是仅仅匹配人类的解释（plausibility）。
On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了视觉信息在MCoT中的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量方法和改进策略。,"Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning Steps,2025,True,False,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出了FUR框架，通过消除推理步骤中的信息来测量忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了新的度量方法。,"When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models'parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models'prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning.",,2,White-box,General,这篇论文明确研究 CoT 忠实性问题，提出了一个名为 FUR 的框架，通过遗忘推理步骤来衡量 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实原因（parametric beliefs）。实验表明 FUR 能够精确改变模型的预测，从而验证 CoT 的忠实性。这完全符合核心定义中的 Faithfulness 研究范畴。
Walk the Talk?

However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's""reasoning""process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.",International Conference on Learning Representations,2,Black-box,Society,这篇论文明确研究了LLM生成解释的忠实度问题，提出了测量忠实度的新方法，并通过社会偏见和医学问答任务展示了不忠实解释的影响，符合核心定义中的Faithfulness研究。
"Beyond Theorem Proving: Formulation, Framework and Benchmark for Formal Problem-Solving",2025,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出基于形式化验证的框架和度量标准，关注过程级验证，与CoT忠实性相关。,"As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Math,论文提出了一个形式化问题解决的框架，并强调了过程级可验证性，这与 CoT Faithfulness 有一定相关性。虽然主要关注的是问题的形式化和解决的准确性，但提出的 RPE 方法用于验证答案的正确性，可以作为 Faithfulness 的旁证。
Towards Faithful Natural Language Explanations: A Study Using Activation Patching in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出使用激活修补技术测量解释的忠实性，并提出了新的度量标准。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating persuasive Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify their answers. However, the faithfulness of these explanations should not be readily trusted at face value. Recent studies have proposed various methods to measure the faithfulness of NLEs, typically by inserting perturbations at the explanation or feature level. We argue that these approaches are neither comprehensive nor correctly designed according to the established definition of faithfulness. Moreover, we highlight the risks of grounding faithfulness findings on out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we leverage a causal mediation technique called activation patching, to measure the faithfulness of an explanation towards supporting the explained answer. Our proposed metric, Causal Faithfulness quantifies the consistency of causal attributions between explanations and the corresponding model outputs as the indicator of faithfulness. We experimented across models varying from 2B to 27B parameters and found that models that underwent alignment tuning tend to produce more faithful and plausible explanations. We find that Causal Faithfulness is a promising improvement over existing faithfulness tests by taking into account the model's internal computations and avoiding out of distribution concerns that could otherwise undermine the validity of faithfulness assessments. We release the code in \url{https://github.com/wj210/Causal-Faithfulness}",,2,White-box,General,论文明确使用激活修补（activation patching）技术来测量解释的忠实度，并提出了因果忠实度（Causal Faithfulness）指标，直接符合 Faithfulness 研究的核心定义。

However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice.

We introduce FaithLM, a model-agnostic framework that evaluates and improves the faithfulness of LLM explanations without token masking or task-specific heuristics. FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines. These findings highlight that intervention-based evaluation, coupled with iterative optimization, provides a principled route toward faithful and reliable LLM explanations.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM生成的解释（如CoT）的忠实性，提出了一种评估和改进解释忠实性的框架FaithLM，并通过干预性评估验证解释的真实性，完全符合Faithfulness的核心研究方向。

To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines.

When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are faithful, i.e., truly capture the factors responsible for the model's predictions. In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness. We then introduce the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) by instantiating CEF on the Counterfactual Test (CT) from Atanasova et al. (2023).

On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers.

By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process.

Consistent Multi-Granular Rationale Extraction for Explainable Multi-hop Fact Verification,2023,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了多粒度理由提取的忠实性和一致性，并提出了新的评估指标。,"The success of deep learning models on multi-hop fact verification has prompted researchers to understand the behavior behind their veracity. One possible way is erasure search: obtaining the rationale by entirely removing a subset of input without compromising the veracity prediction. Although extensively explored, existing approaches fall within the scope of the single-granular (tokens or sentences) explanation, which inevitably leads to explanation redundancy and inconsistency. To address such issues, this paper explores the viability of multi-granular rationale extraction with consistency and faithfulness for explainable multi-hop fact verification. In particular, given a pretrained veracity prediction model, both the token-level explainer and sentence-level explainer are trained simultaneously to obtain multi-granular rationales via differentiable masking. Meanwhile, three diagnostic properties (fidelity, consistency, salience) are introduced and applied to the training process, to ensure that the extracted rationales satisfy faithfulness and consistency.

However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink.

Evaluating Human Alignment and Model Faithfulness of LLM Rationale,2024,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文研究了LLM生成rationale的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了评估框架。,"We study how well large language models (LLMs) explain their generations through rationales -- a set of tokens extracted from the input text that reflect the decision-making process of LLMs. Specifically, we systematically study rationales derived using two approaches: (1) popular prompting-based methods, where prompts are used to guide LLMs in generating rationales, and (2) technical attribution-based methods, which leverage attention or gradients to identify important tokens. Our analysis spans three classification datasets with annotated rationales, encompassing tasks with varying performance levels. While prompting-based self-explanations are widely used, our study reveals that these explanations are not always as""aligned""with the human rationale as attribution-based explanations. Even more so, fine-tuning LLMs to enhance classification task accuracy does not enhance the alignment of prompting-based rationales. Still, it does considerably improve the alignment of attribution-based methods (e.g., InputXGradient). More importantly, we show that prompting-based self-explanation is also less""faithful""than attribution-based explanations, failing to provide a reliable account of the model's decision-making process. To evaluate faithfulness, unlike prior studies that excluded misclassified examples, we evaluate all instances and also examine the impact of fine-tuning and accuracy on alignment and faithfulness. Our findings suggest that inconclusive faithfulness results reported in earlier studies may stem from low classification accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of LLM rationales.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型生成的 rationales（相当于 CoT）的忠实性问题，比较了基于 Prompting 和基于 Attribution 的方法，并发现 Prompting-based 的解释在忠实性上不如 Attribution-based 的解释。此外，它还考察了分类准确率对忠实性评估的影响，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning? Stress-Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitorability,2025,True,True,True,,论文揭示了CoT可能被模型故意模糊以逃避监测的不忠实现象，并提出了评估框架。,"Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires model-specific stress-testing of monitorability.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型在具有对抗性目标时是否会掩盖其 CoT 推理过程（即 obfuscate），这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关。论文探讨了 CoT 是否能够忠实反映模型的实际推理过程，尤其是在对抗性环境下，这直接涉及到 CoT 的忠实度和欺骗性问题。
Towards Better Chain-of-Thought: A Reflection on Effectiveness and Faithfulness,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文研究了CoT的有效性和忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了改进算法。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 的忠实度(Faithfulness)问题，特别是分析了 CoT 与问题、答案之间的信息交互，发现了模型在预测答案时可以从未出现在 CoT 中的问题部分回忆起正确信息的现象，这正是 Faithfulness 研究的核心问题。此外，论文还提出了一个算法来缓解这个问题，并通过实验验证了其方法在提升 CoT 忠实度和有效性方面的效果。因此，该论文属于核心相关的研究范畴。
Preventing Language Models From Hiding Their Reasoning,2023,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文探讨了模型中‘编码推理’的不忠实现象，并提出了评估防御方法和训练策略。,"Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from intermediate steps of reasoning to generate answers to complex problems. When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally. Finally, we describe a methodology that enables the evaluation of defenses against encoded reasoning, and show that, under the right conditions, paraphrasing successfully prevents even the best encoding schemes we built from encoding more than 3 bits of information per KB of text.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了中间推理步骤的忠实性（Faithfulness），特别是探讨了模型可能通过编码方式隐藏真实推理过程（encoded reasoning），并提出了一种评估防御方法的方法论。这直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心问题，即推理步骤是否真实反映了模型的内部计算过程。
Logical Satisfiability of Counterfactuals for Faithful Explanations in NLI,2022,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出基于反事实的忠实性评估方法，涉及不忠实现象和新度量指标。,"Evaluating an explanation's faithfulness is desired for many reasons such as trust, interpretability and diagnosing the sources of model's errors. In this work, which focuses on the NLI task, we introduce the methodology of Faithfulness-through-Counterfactuals, which first generates a counterfactual hypothesis based on the logical predicates expressed in the explanation, and then evaluates if the model's prediction on the counterfactual is consistent with that expressed logic (i.e. if the new formula is \textit{logically satisfiable}). In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model. We first validate the efficacy of automatic counterfactual hypothesis generation, leveraging on the few-shot priming paradigm. Next, we show that our proposed metric distinguishes between human-model agreement and disagreement on new counterfactual input. In addition, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to validate that our metric is sensitive to unfaithful explanations.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,White-box,Logic,该论文明确提出了通过反事实逻辑可满足性来评估解释的忠实度（Faithfulness-through-Counterfactuals），无需训练额外验证模型即可检测不忠实解释（Unfaithful explanations），且实验证明了指标对不忠实解释的敏感性，完全符合核心相关标准。方法涉及逻辑推理的内部一致性验证，属于白盒分析。
Question Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning,2023,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过问题分解提升CoT忠实性，并使用了新度量指标验证。,"As large language models (LLMs) perform more difficult tasks, it becomes harder to verify the correctness and safety of their behavior. One approach to help with this issue is to prompt LLMs to externalize their reasoning, e.g., by having them generate step-by-step reasoning as they answer a question (Chain-of-Thought; CoT). The reasoning may enable us to check the process that models use to perform tasks. However, this approach relies on the stated reasoning faithfully reflecting the model's actual reasoning, which is not always the case. To improve over the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, we have models generate reasoning by decomposing questions into subquestions. Decomposition-based methods achieve strong performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes approaching that of CoT while improving the faithfulness of the model's stated reasoning on several recently-proposed metrics. By forcing the model to answer simpler subquestions in separate contexts, we greatly increase the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT, while still achieving some of the performance gains of CoT. Our results show it is possible to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning; continued improvements may lead to reasoning that enables us to verify the correctness and safety of LLM behavior.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了如何通过问题分解来改进CoT推理的忠实性，提出了提高模型生成推理忠实性的方法，并使用了最近提出的度量标准进行验证。这直接对应于Faithfulness研究的核心定义。
A Hypothesis-Driven Framework for the Analysis of Self-Rationalising Models,2024,True,True,True,,论文探讨了自解释模型的忠实性问题，并提出了评估框架，但未提出改进方法。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of LLMs are appealing because the generated explanations can give insights into the plausibility of the predictions. However, how faithful the explanations are to the predictions is questionable, raising the need to explore the patterns behind them further.To this end, we propose a hypothesis-driven statistical framework. We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM’s and the Bayesian network’s decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5. We discuss the implications of this as well as the framework’s potential to approximate LLM decisions better in future work.",Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了LLM生成解释的忠实性问题，提出了一种统计框架来比较LLM和贝叶斯网络的决策过程，直接关联到Faithfulness的核心问题。
Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning,2025,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出基于Curry-Howard对应关系的验证框架，将CoT映射为形式化证明，属于忠实性度量方法。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确提出了一个基于 Curry-Howard 对应的理论框架，用于验证 CoT 生成的 rationale 的忠实性。通过将 CoT 步骤映射到形式化的类型化证明结构，提供了一种可验证的计算忠实性证书，直接涉及 CoT 的因果角色和忠实性验证方法。
Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,2024,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT忠实性度量的问题，并揭示了度量与模型准确性之间的相关性，质疑其有效性。,"Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接研究 CoT 忠实度（Faithfulness）问题，验证了模型内部计算与 CoT 生成是否一致，并质疑了现有度量标准的有效性（伪装成准确度的忠实度）。
Chart-RVR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards for Explainable Chart Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出通过可验证奖励提升 CoT 忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出了一个框架（Chart-RVR）来增强 Large Vision-Language Models（LVLMs）在图表推理任务中的鲁棒性和可解释性，特别是通过自动可验证的奖励来最大化流程一致性（process conformity）和 faithfulness 的图表表格重建，从而改进 rationale fidelity。这与 CoT Faithfulness 的定义高度相关，尤其是论文中提到的 'improving rationale fidelity' 和 'faithful chart table reconstruction' 直接涉及 CoT 推理的真实性和忠实度。
Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification,2024,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出通过论证框架提升解释性和可争议性，与CoT忠实性相关。,"The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs’ performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了如何通过论证框架增强LLM的解释性，并允许对决策进行争议，虽然涉及了解释性和可争议性，但并未明确研究CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因（Faithfulness的核心定义），因此评为边缘相关。
Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文评估了推理模型的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了度量指标。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究推理模型（DeepSeek-R1）与非推理模型在 Chain-of-Thought 忠实度上的差异，实验设计了多种提示线索（cue）来测试模型是否能准确描述这些线索对其答案的影响。研究直接针对 CoT 解释的真实性（Faithfulness），并通过对比实验验证了不同类型的模型在忠实度上的表现差异，尤其是讨论了奖励模型可能导致不忠诚响应的现象。
Markovian Transformers for Informative Language Modeling,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出了一种新的训练方法，通过强制模型将推理压缩到可解释的文本中，以提高CoT的忠实性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning often fails to faithfully reflect a language model's underlying decision process. We address this by introducing a Markovian language model framework that can be understood as a reasoning autoencoder: it creates a text-based bottleneck where CoT serves as an intermediate representation, forcing the model to compress essential reasoning into interpretable text before making predictions. We train this system with a GRPO-style policy gradient algorithm using parallel sampling, a frozen baseline CoT', within-batch standardized advantages, and actor-reward (chain-rule) gradients. Our approach yields large gains on QA tasks (e.g., GSM8K: 20.7% to 54.5%; +33.8 pp; ARC-Challenge: 47.5% to 76.9%; +29.4 pp). Perturbation analyses across types and severities show consistently higher sensitivity to CoT edits (typically 52%--82% of cases favor Markovian), indicating stronger causal reliance on the CoT. Cross-model evaluation confirms that learned CoTs generalize across architectures, suggesting they capture transferable reasoning patterns rather than model-specific artifacts.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT是否忠实反映模型的决策过程，引入了Markovian框架并通过扰动分析证明CoT的因果依赖性，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。

Test-Time Reasoners Are Strategic Multiple-Choice Test-Takers,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了LLMs在MCQA任务中的推理策略，并测试了其忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文直接研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，通过实验验证了 LLMs 在只给出选项（choices-only）时生成的推理痕迹（reasoning traces）是否真实反映了其决策逻辑（faithfulness tests），并发现这些痕迹揭示了模型并非完全依赖浅层策略（如直接选择答案），而是尝试推断缺失的问题内容。这直接关联到 CoT Faithfulness 的核心议题：推理是否真实反映了模型的计算过程，而非事后合理化（post-hoc rationalization）。

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study.

"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages",2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了多语言CoT推理的性能、一致性和忠实性，并使用了扰动技术来评估忠实性。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees.

Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language Models,2023,True,True,True,,论文提出了量化LLM解释不确定性的新指标，并探讨了解释的忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models.",International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2,Black-box,General,这篇论文明确研究了LLM生成的解释是否可靠并反映了LLM的行为，提出了量化解释不确定性的指标，并发现探测不确定性估计与解释的忠实度相关。这直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义，即解释是否真实反映了模型的计算过程。
Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了VLMs中CoT解释的忠实性问题，并提出了新的评估框架。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues.

We present the first comprehensive study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs), investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent''reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,White-box,Society,该论文直接研究了 CoT 忠实性问题，特别是探讨了文本和图像偏见如何影响推理过程和偏见表达。此外，论文还发现了模型在推理中存在的不一致现象，即‘inconsistent reasoning’，这直接关联到 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的内部计算过程。研究方法和结果都紧密围绕 CoT 忠实性展开，属于核心相关研究。
FaithAct: Faithfulness Planning and Acting in MLLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出了FaithEval评估框架和FaithAct改进方法，关注CoT忠实性。,"Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories.

VisFIS: Visual Feature Importance Supervision with Right-for-the-Right-Reason Objectives,2022,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了模型解释的忠实性，并提出了改进方法。,"Many past works aim to improve visual reasoning in models by supervising feature importance (estimated by model explanation techniques) with human annotations such as highlights of important image regions. However, recent work has shown that performance gains from feature importance (FI) supervision for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks persist even with random supervision, suggesting that these methods do not meaningfully align model FI with human FI. In this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA model accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason (RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate predictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2) max-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3) invariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and (4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations (Plausibility). Our best performing method, Visual Feature Importance Supervision (VisFIS), outperforms strong baselines on benchmark VQA datasets in terms of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. While past work suggests that the mechanism for improved accuracy is through improved explanation plausibility, we show that this relationship depends crucially on explanation faithfulness (whether explanations truly represent the model's internal reasoning). Predictions are more accurate when explanations are plausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful. Lastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of out-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's in-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics for evaluating model reasoning.

On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations,2023,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT解释的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量指标CC-SHAP来评估自洽性。,"Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出评估自然语言解释可信度的框架，关注忠实性，并揭示通用模型的不忠实现象。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2,Black-box,Medical,论文明确提出评估自然语言解释的信任度框架，重点关注 Plausibility 和 Faithfulness。特别指出通用模型在 Faithfulness 上的不一致性，与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关，属于核心文献。
Audit-of-Understanding: Posterior-Constrained Inference for Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出AoU框架，通过验证前提来提升推理忠实性，并实证改进准确性和忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出新度量标准HAF评估LLMs毒性解释的忠实性，揭示了不一致和不相关响应现象。,"The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs'reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs'free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs'toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how""non-ideal""the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,论文明确提出 Human-Aligned Faithfulness 概念，研究LLM毒性解释是否与理性人类的解释一致，直接聚焦于推理过程的忠实度。论文揭示了LLM在毒性推理中的不一致性和无关响应，体现了对解释真实性的研究，属于CoT Faithfulness的核心范畴。
Formal Reasoning for Intelligent QA Systems: A Case Study in the Educational Domain,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM推理的不忠实现象，并提出了结合符号引擎的改进方法。,"Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful—serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness.",,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究了LLM推理轨迹的非忠实性问题（unfaithful），并提出了MCFR框架来提高推理的忠实性和可解释性。此外，论文还对比了MCFR与传统LLM（如ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Claude）的表现，进一步验证了其在忠实性方面的改进。
Evaluating Explanation Methods for Vision-and-Language Navigation,2023,False,False,True,,论文关注视觉与语言导航中的解释方法，但未明确涉及CoT。,"The ability to navigate robots with natural language instructions in an unknown environment is a crucial step for achieving embodied artificial intelligence (AI). With the improving performance of deep neural models proposed in the field of vision-and-language navigation (VLN), it is equally interesting to know what information the models utilize for their decision-making in the navigation tasks. To understand the inner workings of deep neural models, various explanation methods have been developed for promoting explainable AI (XAI). But they are mostly applied to deep neural models for image or text classification tasks and little work has been done in explaining deep neural models for VLN tasks. In this paper, we address these problems by building quantitative benchmarks to evaluate explanation methods for VLN models in terms of faithfulness. We propose a new erasure-based evaluation pipeline to measure the step-wise textual explanation in the sequential decision-making setting. We evaluate several explanation methods for two representative VLN models on two popular VLN datasets and reveal valuable findings through our experiments.",European Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,White-box,General,该论文研究视觉语言导航(VLN)模型的解释方法忠实度评估，建立了基于擦除的量化评估框架来测量序列决策过程中的解释忠实性。虽然研究领域是导航任务而非典型的CoT推理，但其核心关注解释方法是否真实反映模型决策过程，这与CoT忠实度的研究方向高度一致。论文提出的忠实度评估方法论对CoT忠实度研究具有参考价值。

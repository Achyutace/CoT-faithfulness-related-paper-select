State over Tokens: Characterizing the Role of Reasoning Tokens,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了State over Tokens框架来解释这一现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究CoT（推理标记）是否忠实反映模型的实际推理过程，揭示了推理标记并非真实解释的现象，并提出了SoT框架以重新理解这些标记作为计算状态的角色。这直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义，尤其是关于Post-hoc Rationalization和Causal proxy的讨论。
Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT推理与记忆检索的不一致性，并提出了改进方法FARL。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively""hacking""the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 推理与记忆检索之间的不一致性，揭示了模型可能通过检索机制‘欺骗’奖励信号，从而削弱真正的推理发展。这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关，即研究 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实原因。
Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling,2025,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的忠实性问题，提出了通过重采样进行因果分析的方法，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In""agentic misalignment""scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes""unfaithful"", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实原因（Causal role），通过重采样方法探讨模型决策的因果影响。论文还讨论了 CoT 的‘unfaithful’现象，并提出了测量 Faithfulness 的指标（如 resilience metric 和 causal mediation analysis）。这些内容直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT的忠实性和详细程度，提出了新的度量指标，并揭示了不忠实现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（faithfulness）和详尽性（verbosity），并提出了一个综合的可监控性评分来衡量 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的内部推理过程。这直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义，即 CoT 是否真实反映了模型做出预测的实际计算过程。
Reasoning-Grounded Natural Language Explanations for Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种基于推理过程的解释方法，以提高忠实性，并讨论了模型复制部分决策的现象。,"We propose a large language model explainability technique for obtaining faithful natural language explanations by grounding the explanations in a reasoning process. When converted to a sequence of tokens, the outputs of the reasoning process can become part of the model context and later be decoded to natural language as the model produces either the final answer or the explanation. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we propose to use a joint predict-explain approach, in which the answers and explanations are inferred directly from the reasoning sequence, without the explanations being dependent on the answers and vice versa. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed technique by achieving a high alignment between answers and explanations in several problem domains, observing that language models often simply copy the partial decisions from the reasoning sequence into the final answers or explanations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed use of reasoning can also improve the quality of the answers.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究如何通过将解释基于推理过程来提高解释的忠实度（faithfulness），并提出了联合预测-解释方法，确保解释不依赖于答案，反之亦然。这直接符合CoT Faithfulness的核心定义，即研究解释是否真实反映模型的预测过程。
Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文揭示了CoT中存在真假思考步骤的现象，并提出了度量指标TTS和白盒干预方法。,"Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning steps don't truly contribute to LLMs'prediction. We measure the step-wise causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS>= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model. Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs. By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究CoT中推理步骤的真实因果影响（True Thinking Score），揭示了模型可能生成装饰性思考步骤（Decorative-thinking steps）而非真实反映内部计算过程的现象，并提出了通过潜在空间操控验证因果性的方法，完全符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Towards Transparent Reasoning: What Drives Faithfulness in Large Language Models?,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文探讨了LLM的解释忠实性问题，并提出了改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,论文明确研究了解释的忠实性问题，特别是在医疗和社会偏见领域，探讨了推理和训练选择如何影响解释的忠实性，符合核心相关标准。
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,True,True,True,,论文研究了CoT的学习动态，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了量化框架。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究了 CoT 的忠实度问题，特别是发现了训练过程中存在短暂的 'trace unfaithfulness' 阶段，即模型在早期训练阶段会产生正确但推理步骤不忠实的情况。此外，论文还从机制上分析了 CoT 如何改变 transformer 的内部计算过程，这些都直接涉及 CoT 的忠实性问题。
DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs生成看似合理但错误的CoT的不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs'own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

Thinking About Thinking: SAGE-nano's Inverse Reasoning for Self-Aware Language Models,2025,True,False,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出逆向推理方法，通过元认知结构提升模型对自身推理链的解释能力，涉及忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.

Causal-driven Large Language Models with Faithful Reasoning for Knowledge Question Answering,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出基于因果推理的框架CORE，旨在提升忠实推理，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"In Large Language Models (LLMs), text generation that involves knowledge representation is often fraught with the risk of ""hallucinations'', where models confidently produce erroneous or fabricated content. These inaccuracies often stem from intrinsic biases in the pre-training stage or from the incorporation of human preference biases during the fine-tuning process. To mitigate these issues, we take inspiration from Goldman's causal theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge is not merely about having a true belief but also involves a causal connection between the belief and the truth of the proposition. We instantiate this theory within the context of Knowledge Question Answering (KQA) by constructing a causal graph that delineates the pathways between the candidate knowledge and belief. Through the application of the do-calculus rules from structural causal models, we devise an unbiased estimation framework based on this causal graph, thereby establishing a methodology for knowledge modeling grounded in causal inference. The resulting CORE framework (short for ""Causal knOwledge REasoning'') is comprised of four essential components: question answering, causal reasoning, belief scoring, and refinement. Together, they synergistically improve the KQA system by fostering faithful reasoning and introspection. Extensive experiments are conducted on ScienceQA and HotpotQA datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the CORE framework.",ACM Multimedia,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究如何通过因果推理（causal reasoning）促进忠实推理（faithful reasoning），并构建因果图来确保知识问答中信念与真相的因果连接，直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了模型在CoT中隐藏奖励黑客行为的不忠实现象，并提出了VFT方法来提升忠实性。,"Language models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can engage in reward hacking--the exploitation of unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning. This makes the detection of reward hacking difficult, posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g.,""a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A""). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit these cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low even after RL (11% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型在 Chain-of-Thought 推理中是否真实反映了其预测过程（即是否隐藏了奖励黑客行为），并提出了干预方法（VFT）以提高模型的忠实度。这直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义，尤其是关于模型是否在 CoT 中诚实表达其内部决策过程的问题。
Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过自玩游戏提升模型推理过程的理性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.",International Conference on Machine Learning,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究如何通过自我游戏提升语言模型在推理过程中的理性，即模型是否真正理解其推理过程。这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义相符，即研究模型生成的解释是否真实反映了其预测的实际计算过程。
Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了黑盒方法评估CoT中句子的重要性，与Faithfulness相关。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Math,论文明确研究 CoT 中哪些句子对最终答案有因果影响（Counterfactual importance），并发现特定句子（Thought Anchors）对推理轨迹和最终答案有显著影响。这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题，即解释是否真实反映模型的推理过程。
Unveiling Confirmation Bias in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文揭示了CoT中的确认偏误现象，并提出了改进提示策略的需求。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance. Code is available at \textit{https://github.com/yuewan2/biasedcot}.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT推理中的确认偏差（confirmation bias），即模型内部信念如何影响推理生成和答案预测，这与Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关。论文通过分解CoT为两阶段过程，分析了模型信念、理由属性和阶段性能之间的相关性，揭示了模型推理过程中的不忠实现象。
Counterfactual Evaluation for Explainable AI,2021,True,False,True,,论文提出了基于反事实推理的新评估方法，直接针对解释的忠实性度量。,"While recent years have witnessed the emergence of various explainable methods in machine learning, to what degree the explanations really represent the reasoning process behind the model prediction -- namely, the faithfulness of explanation -- is still an open problem. One commonly used way to measure faithfulness is \textit{erasure-based} criteria. Though conceptually simple, erasure-based criterion could inevitably introduce biases and artifacts. We propose a new methodology to evaluate the faithfulness of explanations from the \textit{counterfactual reasoning} perspective: the model should produce substantially different outputs for the original input and its corresponding counterfactual edited on a faithful feature. Specially, we introduce two algorithms to find the proper counterfactuals in both discrete and continuous scenarios and then use the acquired counterfactuals to measure faithfulness. Empirical results on several datasets show that compared with existing metrics, our proposed counterfactual evaluation method can achieve top correlation with the ground truth under diffe",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究解释的忠实度（faithfulness），并提出了一种基于反事实推理（counterfactual reasoning）的新方法来评估解释是否真实反映了模型的推理过程。这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义高度相关，特别是通过反事实输入来测量忠实度。
Diagnostics-Guided Explanation Generation,2021,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了如何优化解释的忠实性，并提出了直接优化诊断属性的训练方法。,"Explanations shed light on a machine learning model's rationales and can aid in identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model. Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the confidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for these diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level explanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human rationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了解释生成的忠实度（Faithfulness），并提出了优化忠实度的方法，同时讨论了其他诊断属性如数据一致性和置信指示，这些都是衡量解释是否真实反映模型预测过程的关键因素。

In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了语言模型在生成链式思考（CoT）时的内部机制，特别是通过隐藏激活状态来控制和预测模型的不确定性。这直接关联到模型生成的解释是否真实反映了其预测过程，即Faithfulness的核心问题。

Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper, we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the draft conclusions.

X-Node: Self-Explanation is All We Need,2025,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出X-Node框架，通过构建结构化上下文向量生成忠实解释，解码器确保解释与内部嵌入一致，属于提升忠实性的内部机制方法。,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a""text-injection""mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones.

Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2) parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal tests.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 Vision-Language Models (VLMs) 生成的 Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) 是否忠实反映了模型预测的因果因素，并提出了 Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT) 方法来验证解释的忠实性。这直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义，特别是通过反事实测试（Counterfactual input）来测量解释的忠实度。
Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过微调LLMs遵循医学指南进行推理，提出了评估推理过程忠实性的方法。,"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.",,2,Black-box,Medical,该论文明确研究如何通过微调LLMs使其遵循医学共识指南进行逐步推理和预测，强调了解释的忠实性（faithful explanations）和推导正确性（derivation correctness），直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。
Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability,2025,True,False,False,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文探讨了通过内部激活解码 CoT 的方法，属于 Faithfulness 的白盒评估。,"As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究模型内部机制（如logit lens分析）以解码隐藏的推理过程（ROT-13加密的CoT），直接验证解释是否反映实际计算过程，属于Faithfulness的核心研究。
Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior and the Risks of Promoting Obfuscation,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了CoT监控和奖励黑客行为，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了通过训练改进的方法。,"Mitigating reward hacking--where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or misspecifications in their learning objectives--remains a key challenge in constructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Code,该论文明确研究了模型通过CoT进行奖励黑客行为（reward hacking）的现象，即模型在CoT中隐藏其真实意图，这直接涉及CoT的忠实性问题。论文还探讨了如何通过监控CoT来检测这种不忠实行为，属于核心相关研究。

Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence.

This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds.

We study two text classification tasks: sentiment classification and forced labour detection, i.e., identifying pre-defined risk indicators of forced labour. In addition to English, we include Danish and Italian translations of the sentiment classification task and compare self-explanations to human annotations for all samples. To allow for direct comparisons, we also compute post-hoc feature attribution, i.e., layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and analyse 4 LLMs. We show that self-explanations align more closely with human annotations compared to LRP, while maintaining a comparable level of faithfulness.

Is the MMI Criterion Necessary for Interpretability? Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise for Self-Rationalization,2024,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了非因果特征对解释性的影响，并提出了新的准则来提升忠实性。,"An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely used criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features non-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information, complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods have been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance penalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely remedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious features are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery of causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats spurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich in spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making rationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either plain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional distribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However, significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal features are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a criterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy (MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion improves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated rationales) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI variants.

This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks.

Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文讨论了LLM模拟社会行为时缺乏内部一致性和因果推理的问题，并提出了评估框架RECAP来提升推理忠实性。,"Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist""demographics in, behavior out""paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions. To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency.

This paper proposes ProoFVer, which uses a seq2seq model to generate natural logic-based inferences as proofs. These proofs consist of lexical mutations between spans in the claim and the evidence retrieved, each marked with a natural logic operator. Claim veracity is determined solely based on the sequence of these operators. Hence, these proofs are faithful explanations, and this makes ProoFVer faithful by construction. Currently, ProoFVer has the highest label accuracy and the second best score in the FEVER leaderboard. Furthermore, it improves by 13.21% points over the next best model on a dataset with counterfactual instances, demonstrating its robustness.

Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了基于激活的监控方法。,"Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,Society,该论文明确研究了CoT的忠实性问题，发现CoT文本常常是不忠实且误导的（unfaithful and misleading），而模型潜在状态提供了更可靠的预测信号。此外，论文还识别了一类称为'performative CoTs'的响应，其中推理过程与最终响应持续矛盾，这直接涉及CoT的忠实性问题。
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,True,True,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文探讨了LLM自我解释的忠实性问题，并提出了自我一致性检查作为度量方法。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general.

Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations.

We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points.

Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer.

This behavior, a direct consequence of training objectives that solely reward final-answer correctness, severely undermines the trustworthiness of these models in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces \textbf{Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)}, a novel training objective designed to forge a strong, causal-like dependence between a model's output and its intermediate reasoning steps. During training, CSR performs automated, operator-level interventions on the generated reasoning trace (e.g., swapping ``+''with ``-'') to create a minimally-perturbed counterfactual. A regularization term then penalizes the model if this logically flawed trace still yields the original answer. Our efficient implementation adds only 8.7\% training overhead through warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization. We evaluate faithfulness using \textbf{Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)}, a metric quantifying how sensitive the final answer is to such logical perturbations. Across diverse structured reasoning benchmarks -- arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop QA (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP) -- models trained with CSR demonstrate a vastly superior trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, with this learned sensitivity generalizing to larger models and enhancing the performance of inference-time techniques like self-consistency.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，提出了 Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR) 方法来增强模型推理步骤与最终答案之间的因果依赖关系，并通过 Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS) 指标量化忠实性。这直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义，属于核心相关研究。

Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal.

FaiRR: Faithful and Robust Deductive Reasoning over Natural Language,2022,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出模块化组件确保推理步骤与推理过程有因果联系，提升忠实性。,"Transformers have been shown to be able to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,论文明确研究如何通过模块化设计（规则选择、事实选择、知识组合）确保推理过程的忠实性（Faithfulness），并强调因果关系的保证。此外，论文还对比了传统黑盒模型可能存在的非忠实性（Unfaithful）问题，符合核心相关标准。

While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究多模态CoT中生成的rationale是否被模型实际利用（即Faithfulness问题），并提出RED方法通过KL约束优化rationale条件概率以提升忠实度，符合核心定义。
Natural Language Deduction through Search over Statement Compositions,2022,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种通过搜索过程分解任务的方法，生成反映推理过程的中间结论树，符合CoT忠实性定义。,"In settings from fact-checking to question answering, we frequently want to know whether a collection of evidence (premises) entails a hypothesis. Existing methods primarily focus on the end-to-end discriminative version of this task, but less work has treated the generative version in which a model searches over the space of statements entailed by the premises to constructively derive the hypothesis. We propose a system for doing this kind of deductive reasoning in natural language by decomposing the task into separate steps coordinated by a search procedure, producing a tree of intermediate conclusions that faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process. Our experiments on the EntailmentBank dataset (Dalvi et al., 2021) demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully prove true statements while rejecting false ones. Moreover, it produces natural language explanations with a 17% absolute higher step validity than those produced by an end-to-end T5 model.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确研究生成式自然语言演绎推理，通过搜索过程构建中间结论树，强调其推理过程忠实反映系统内部计算（'faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process'），直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。实验通过验证步骤有效性（step validity）衡量解释的忠实性，属于因果性分析而非事后合理化。
Measuring Association Between Labels and Free-Text Rationales,2020,True,True,True,,论文研究了自由文本理由的忠实性，提出了评估指标，但未提出改进方法。,"In interpretable NLP, we require faithful rationales that reflect the model’s decision-making process for an explained instance. While prior work focuses on extractive rationales (a subset of the input words), we investigate their less-studied counterpart: free-text natural language rationales. We demonstrate that *pipelines*, models for faithful rationalization on information-extraction style tasks, do not work as well on “reasoning” tasks requiring free-text rationales. We turn to models that *jointly* predict and rationalize, a class of widely used high-performance models for free-text rationalization. We investigate the extent to which the labels and rationales predicted by these models are associated, a necessary property of faithful explanation. Via two tests, *robustness equivalence* and *feature importance agreement*, we find that state-of-the-art T5-based joint models exhibit desirable properties for explaining commonsense question-answering and natural language inference, indicating their potential for producing faithful free-text rationales.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自由文本解释（类似CoT）与模型预测标签之间的关联性，提出两个测试（robustness equivalence和feature importance agreement）来验证解释的忠实性，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Text Modular Networks: Learning to Decompose Tasks in the Language of Existing Models,2021,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出通过分解任务生成子问题，确保解释的忠实性，属于改进方法中的验证与外部工具。,"We propose a general framework called Text Modular Networks(TMNs) for building interpretable systems that learn to solve complex tasks by decomposing them into simpler ones solvable by existing models. To ensure solvability of simpler tasks, TMNs learn the textual input-output behavior (i.e., language) of existing models through their datasets. This differs from prior decomposition-based approaches which, besides being designed specifically for each complex task, produce decompositions independent of existing sub-models. Specifically, we focus on Question Answering (QA) and show how to train a next-question generator to sequentially produce sub-questions targeting appropriate sub-models, without additional human annotation. These sub-questions and answers provide a faithful natural language explanation of the model’s reasoning. We use this framework to build ModularQA, a system that can answer multi-hop reasoning questions by decomposing them into sub-questions answerable by a neural factoid single-span QA model and a symbolic calculator. Our experiments show that ModularQA is more versatile than existing explainable systems for DROP and HotpotQA datasets, is more robust than state-of-the-art blackbox (uninterpretable) systems, and generates more understandable and trustworthy explanations compared to prior work.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提出了通过分解任务生成子问题的方法，并强调这些子问题和答案提供了模型推理的忠实自然语言解释（faithful natural language explanation），直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Semi-structured LLM Reasoners Can Be Rigorously Audited,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出半结构化推理模型（SSRMs）以解决不忠实现象，并引入自动审计方法来检测推理错误。,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable reasoners, the problem of faithfulness persists: their reasoning can contain errors and omissions that are difficult to detect and that may obscure biases in model outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning Models (SSRMs), which are trained to produce semi-structured representations of reasoning. SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a non-executable Pythonic syntax that names each reasoning step and marks its inputs and outputs. This structure allows SSRM traces to be automatically audited to identify reasoning flaws. We evaluate three types of audits: hand-crafted structured reasoning audits, written in a domain-specific language (DSL) implemented in Python; LLM-generated structured reasoning audits; and learned typicality audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning traces. We show that all of these methods can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors. Importantly, the auditability of SSRMs does not appear to compromise overall accuracy: in evaluation on twelve benchmarks and two model families, SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generalizability relative to other models of comparable size.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究LLM推理的忠实性问题，提出半结构化推理模型（SSRMs）以生成可审计的推理轨迹，并通过多种审计方法检测推理错误。这直接涉及CoT的忠实性，属于核心相关研究。
Human Ratings Do Not Reflect Downstream Utility: A Study of Free-Text Explanations for Model Predictions,2022,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了模型生成的解释与下游任务效用不一致的现象，并提出了通过微调改进的方法。,"Models able to generate free-text rationales that explain their output have been proposed as an important step towards interpretable NLP for “reasoning” tasks such as natural language inference and commonsense question answering. However, the relative merits of different architectures and types of rationales are not well understood and hard to measure. In this paper, we contribute two insights to this line of research: First, we find that models trained on gold explanations learn to rely on these but, in the case of the more challenging question answering data set we use, fail when given generated explanations at test time. However, additional fine-tuning on generated explanations teaches the model to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information in explanations. Second, we compare explanations by a generation-only model to those generated by a self-rationalizing model and find that, while the former score higher in terms of validity, factual correctness, and similarity to gold explanations, they are not more useful for downstream classification. We observe that the self-rationalizing model is prone to hallucination, which is punished by most metrics but may add useful context for the classification step.",BlackboxNLP Workshop on Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型生成的自由文本解释（rationales）是否真实反映了模型预测的实际计算过程，特别是探讨了模型如何依赖生成的解释以及这些解释对下游任务的有用性。此外，论文还讨论了模型在解释中可能出现的幻觉（hallucination）现象，这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义密切相关。

A common way of incorporating facts from the graph is to encode them separately from the question, and then combine the two representations to select an answer. In this paper, we argue that highly faithful graph-based explanations cannot be extracted from existing models of this type. Such explanations will not include reasoning done by the transformer encoding the question, so will be incomplete. We confirm this theory with a novel proxy measure for faithfulness and propose two architecture changes to address the problem. Our findings suggest a path forward for developing architectures for faithful graph-based explanations.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,White-box,Society,该论文明确研究知识图谱解释的忠实度（Faithfulness），提出了一种新的代理测量方法，并探讨了模型架构变化以提高解释的忠实性。这直接符合 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义，特别是关于解释是否真实反映模型预测的计算过程。
EPT-X: An Expression-Pointer Transformer model that generates eXplanations for numbers,2022,True,False,False,,论文提出了一种生成数学问题解释的模型，并讨论了忠实性，但未涉及不忠实现象或新度量方法。,"In this paper, we propose a neural model EPT-X (Expression-Pointer Transformer with Explanations), which utilizes natural language explanations to solve an algebraic word problem. To enhance the explainability of the encoding process of a neural model, EPT-X adopts the concepts of plausibility and faithfulness which are drawn from math word problem solving strategies by humans. A plausible explanation is one that includes contextual information for the numbers and variables that appear in a given math word problem. A faithful explanation is one that accurately represents the reasoning process behind the model’s solution equation. The EPT-X model yields an average baseline performance of 69.59% on our PEN dataset and produces explanations with quality that is comparable to human output. The contribution of this work is two-fold.

Causal Abstraction for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Arithmetic Word Problems,2023,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文探讨了CoT在算术问题中的因果影响，揭示了LLMs使用CoT进行推理的现象，并提出了因果抽象评估方法。,"Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps, or a chain of thought (CoT), before their final answer. However, it is unclear how exactly CoTs improve LLMs’ accuracy, and in particular, if LLMs use their CoTs to reason to their final answers. This paper tries to answer this question with respect to arithmetic word problems, by (i) evaluating the correctness of LLMs’ CoTs, and (ii) using causal abstraction to assess if the intermediate tokens produced as part of a CoT causally impact LLMs’ final answers, in line with the reasoning described by the CoT. We find that for CoT-prompted LLMs, correct answers to arithmetic problems are highly correlated with correct CoTs, and that when LLMs produce correct CoTs, they realize to a fairly large extent the causal models suggested by their CoTs. Higher degrees of realization also seem associated with better overall accuracy on the arithmetic problems. These findings suggest that some CoT-prompted LLMs may do better on multi-step arithmetic reasoning at least partly because they use their CoTs to reason to their final answers. However, for some LLMs, other internal processes may also be involved.",BlackboxNLP Workshop on Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP,2,White-box,Math,该论文明确研究 CoT 是否因果影响模型的最终答案，使用因果抽象方法评估 CoT 的忠实度，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。

As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that while CoT monitoring is more effective than overseeing only model outputs in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage, reasoning traces can contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the CoT monitors, reducing performance in obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores model reasoning and actions, and combines them using a weighted average. Our hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates twice higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Code,该论文明确研究了CoT监控中的欺骗性现象，即推理轨迹可能包含误导性合理化（misleading rationalizations），直接涉及CoT的忠实度问题。此外，论文还提出了混合协议来独立评分模型推理和行动，这属于测量Faithfulness的方法。
ERASER: A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models,2019,True,False,True,,论文提出了评估模型解释忠实性的新指标和框架，与CoT Faithfulness相关。,"State-of-the-art models in NLP are now predominantly based on deep neural networks that are opaque in terms of how they come to make predictions. This limitation has increased interest in designing more interpretable deep models for NLP that reveal the ‘reasoning’ behind model outputs. But work in this direction has been conducted on different datasets and tasks with correspondingly unique aims and metrics; this makes it difficult to track progress. We propose the Evaluating Rationales And Simple English Reasoning (ERASER a benchmark to advance research on interpretable models in NLP. This benchmark comprises multiple datasets and tasks for which human annotations of “rationales” (supporting evidence) have been collected. We propose several metrics that aim to capture how well the rationales provided by models align with human rationales, and also how faithful these rationales are (i.e., the degree to which provided rationales influenced the corresponding predictions). Our hope is that releasing this benchmark facilitates progress on designing more interpretable NLP systems.

Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过自我批评和细化框架提升解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自然语言解释（NLEs）的忠实度问题，提出了一种自我批判和细化的框架（SR-NLE）来改善解释的忠实度。论文通过实验证明该方法显著降低了不忠实率，表明LLMs可以更好地反映其实际推理过程。这直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义，即解释是否真实反映了模型的预测过程。
Obtaining Faithful Interpretations from Compositional Neural Networks,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了NMNs中间输出与预期不符的不忠实现象，并提出了通过辅助监督训练改进的方法。,"Neural module networks (NMNs) are a popular approach for modeling compositionality: they achieve high accuracy when applied to problems in language and vision, while reflecting the compositional structure of the problem in the network architecture. However, prior work implicitly assumed that the structure of the network modules, describing the abstract reasoning process, provides a faithful explanation of the model’s reasoning; that is, that all modules perform their intended behaviour. In this work, we propose and conduct a systematic evaluation of the intermediate outputs of NMNs on NLVR2 and DROP, two datasets which require composing multiple reasoning steps. We find that the intermediate outputs differ from the expected output, illustrating that the network structure does not provide a faithful explanation of model behaviour. To remedy that, we train the model with auxiliary supervision and propose particular choices for module architecture that yield much better faithfulness, at a minimal cost to accuracy.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了神经网络模块（NMN）的中间输出是否忠实反映了模型的推理过程，发现模块结构与实际行为不一致，并通过辅助监督和模块架构改进提升忠实度。这直接符合Faithfulness的核心定义，尤其是对模型内部机制的分析和因果关系的验证。

In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自由文本解释的忠实度（Faithfulness），提出了 Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) 一致性作为衡量标准，并发现大语言模型生成的解释中有超过 62% 缺乏这种一致性。此外，论文还探讨了如何通过直接偏好优化来提高解释的忠实度，这与 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关。
Why do you think that? Exploring faithful sentence–level rationales without supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了如何通过无监督方法生成忠实解释，并提出了训练框架来提升解释的忠实性。,"Evaluating the trustworthiness of a model’s prediction is essential for differentiating between ‘right for the right reasons’ and ‘right for the wrong reasons’. Identifying textual spans that determine the target label, known as faithful rationales, usually relies on pipeline approaches or reinforcement learning. However, such methods either require supervision and thus costly annotation of the rationales or employ non-differentiable models. We propose a differentiable training–framework to create models which output faithful rationales on a sentence level, by solely applying supervision on the target task. To achieve this, our model solves the task based on each rationale individually and learns to assign high scores to those which solved the task best. Our evaluation on three different datasets shows competitive results compared to a standard BERT blackbox while exceeding a pipeline counterpart’s performance in two cases. We further exploit the transparent decision–making process of these models to prefer selecting the correct rationales by applying direct supervision, thereby boosting the performance on the rationale–level.",Findings,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究如何生成忠实的解释（faithful rationales），并探讨模型预测是否基于正确的理由（'right for the right reasons'）。虽然它关注的是句子级别的解释而非CoT，但其核心问题与Faithfulness高度相关，即解释是否真实反映了模型的决策过程。
Leakage-Adjusted Simulatability: Can Models Generate Non-Trivial Explanations of Their Behavior in Natural Language?,2020,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出新的度量标准LAS评估解释的忠实性，并讨论了模型生成解释的合理性问题。,"Data collection for natural language (NL) understanding tasks has increasingly included human explanations alongside data points, allowing past works to introduce models that both perform a task and generate NL explanations for their outputs. Yet to date, model-generated explanations have been evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations, both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the problem of evaluating explanations from the the model simulatability perspective. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how well explanations help an observer predict a model’s output, while controlling for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores.",Findings,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究模型生成的解释是否支持实际模型行为（faithfulness），而非仅仅匹配人类的解释（plausibility）。提出了泄漏调整可模拟性（LAS）指标来衡量解释的忠实度，并探讨了解释生成的多代理游戏优化方法，直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心问题。
On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了视觉信息在MCoT中的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量方法和改进策略。,"Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型在推理和记忆之间的动态平衡，通过识别模型残差流中的线性特征来控制真正的推理和记忆回忆之间的平衡。这些特征不仅可以区分推理任务和记忆密集型任务，还可以被操纵以因果影响模型在推理任务上的表现。这直接涉及模型生成解释（CoT/Reasoning Trace）是否真实反映了模型做出最终预测的实际计算过程，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning Steps,2025,True,False,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出了FUR框架，通过消除推理步骤中的信息来测量忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了新的度量方法。,"When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models'parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models'prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度问题，提出了 FUR 方法来测量模型生成的推理步骤是否忠实于模型的参数信念。通过消除推理步骤中的信息并观察预测变化，直接验证了 CoT 的因果作用。
Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了偏好优化导致CoT不忠实的问题，并提出了通过因果归因改进的方法。,"Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in""reward hacking""by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT解释的忠实度问题，指出偏好优化可能导致解释不忠实（reward hacking），并提出了通过因果归因来检测解释与决策过程之间不一致的方法，直接针对Faithfulness的核心问题。

Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations,2025,True,True,True,,论文聚焦CoT忠实性度量，揭示事后找补现象，提出基于反事实和贝叶斯模型的新评估框架，但未提出改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's""reasoning""process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.",International Conference on Learning Representations,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM生成解释的忠实性问题，提出了测量忠实性的新方法，并使用了反事实输入来验证解释的真实性。此外，论文还揭示了在社会偏见和医学问答任务中LLM解释的不忠实现象，完全符合CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。

We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup.

Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出Logic-of-Thought方法解决CoT的不忠实问题，属于改进方法中的Prompting类别。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确提到 Chain-of-Thought 存在 unfaithful 问题，即生成的推理链与最终结论不一致，这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题。论文提出的 Logic-of-Thought (LoT) 方法旨在通过命题逻辑增强逻辑推理的完整性，从而解决信息丢失导致的推理不忠实问题。
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT推理中的不忠实现象，如事后找补和逻辑捷径，但未提出新的度量或改进方法。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven.

Step-KTO: Optimizing Mathematical Reasoning through Stepwise Binary Feedback,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出 Step-KTO 训练框架，通过过程级和结果级反馈提升推理忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities.",,2,Black-box,Math,该论文明确研究如何通过过程级和结果级反馈来确保推理过程的连贯性和可靠性，直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题。论文关注的是中间推理步骤的质量，而不仅仅是最终答案的正确性，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Towards Faithful Natural Language Explanations: A Study Using Activation Patching in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出使用激活修补技术测量解释的忠实性，并提出了新的度量标准。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating persuasive Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify their answers. However, the faithfulness of these explanations should not be readily trusted at face value. Recent studies have proposed various methods to measure the faithfulness of NLEs, typically by inserting perturbations at the explanation or feature level. We argue that these approaches are neither comprehensive nor correctly designed according to the established definition of faithfulness. Moreover, we highlight the risks of grounding faithfulness findings on out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we leverage a causal mediation technique called activation patching, to measure the faithfulness of an explanation towards supporting the explained answer. Our proposed metric, Causal Faithfulness quantifies the consistency of causal attributions between explanations and the corresponding model outputs as the indicator of faithfulness. We experimented across models varying from 2B to 27B parameters and found that models that underwent alignment tuning tend to produce more faithful and plausible explanations. We find that Causal Faithfulness is a promising improvement over existing faithfulness tests by taking into account the model's internal computations and avoiding out of distribution concerns that could otherwise undermine the validity of faithfulness assessments.

However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes.

Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice.

A Concrete Roadmap towards Safety Cases based on Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文探讨了 CoT 监控对安全性的影响，涉及 faithfulness 问题和验证工具。,"As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 监控的忠实性问题，提出了确保 CoT faithfulness 的技术，并分析了可能导致不忠实 CoT 的威胁（如神经语言和编码推理）。
FaithLM: Towards Faithful Explanations for Large Language Models,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出FaithLM框架，评估和改进LLM解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和度量指标。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly produce natural language explanations, yet these explanations often lack faithfulness, and they do not reliably reflect the evidence the model uses to decide. We introduce FaithLM, a model-agnostic framework that evaluates and improves the faithfulness of LLM explanations without token masking or task-specific heuristics. FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines. These findings highlight that intervention-based evaluation, coupled with iterative optimization, provides a principled route toward faithful and reliable LLM explanations.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM解释的忠实性（faithfulness），提出了一种模型无关的框架FaithLM来评估和改进解释的忠实性。通过干预属性（intervention property）来形式化解释的忠实性，即当解释内容被反驳时，预测应发生变化。这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义高度一致，即研究解释是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程。
Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations from Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,,论文讨论了LLM生成自解释的忠实性与合理性之间的对立，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern LLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate reasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs. While there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving faithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel methods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling transparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,"论文明确讨论了LLM生成的自解释（Self-explanations, SEs）的忠实性（faithfulness）与合理性（plausibility）之间的对立关系，指出LLM生成的解释虽然看似合理，但并不一定反映其真实的推理过程。这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关，即研究解释是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程。"

It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones.

To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT的忠实度问题，通过因果中介分析验证了LLM是否可靠地使用中间推理步骤，并提出了FRODO框架来改善忠实度。研究涉及模型内部机制和因果分析，属于白盒方法，且任务领域为通用。

In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness. We then introduce the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) by instantiating CEF on the Counterfactual Test (CT) from Atanasova et al. (2023).

We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it.

Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives.

But CoT can also systematically misrepresent the factors influencing models'behavior -- for example, rationalizing answers in line with a user's opinion. We first create a new dataset of 9 different biases that affect GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-8b models. These consist of spurious-few-shot patterns, post hoc rationalization, and sycophantic settings. Models switch to the answer implied by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT. To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86\% on held-out tasks. Moreover, this model generalizes to other forms of bias, reducing biased reasoning on held-out biases by an average of 37\%.

However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations.

It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process.

ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.

On the Impact of Fine-Tuning on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2024,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了微调对CoT推理忠实性的影响，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large language models have emerged as powerful tools for general intelligence, showcasing advanced natural language processing capabilities that find applications across diverse domains. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted the potential for significant enhancements in LLMs' task-specific performance through fine-tuning strategies like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (Q-LoRA) method. However, previous works have shown that while fine-tuning offers significant performance gains, it also leads to challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and privacy and safety risks. To this end, there has been little to no work in \textit{understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs}. Our research investigates the effect of fine-tuning on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing critical questions regarding the impact of task-specific fine-tuning on overall reasoning capabilities, the influence of fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning performance, and the implications for the faithfulness of CoT reasonings. By exploring these dimensions, our study shows the impact of fine-tuning on LLM reasoning capabilities, where the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, on average across four datasets, decreases, highlighting potential shifts in internal mechanisms of the LLMs resulting from fine-tuning processes.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了微调对CoT推理忠实度的影响，探讨了微调如何改变LLM的内部机制，并直接提到了faithfulness的下降，属于核心相关研究。

While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文研究了通过上下文学习（ICL）产生的广泛不对齐（Emergent Misalignment）现象，并分析了逐步推理（Chain-of-Thought）中的忠实度问题。研究发现，67.5%的不对齐推理轨迹明确合理化有害输出，这表明生成的解释（CoT）并未真实反映模型的实际计算过程，属于典型的 Faithfulness 研究范畴。

Our research introduces a task-agnostic framework for evaluating free-text rationales, drawing on insights from both linguistics and machine learning. We evaluate two dimensions of explainability: fidelity and interpretability. For fidelity, we propose methods suitable for proprietary LLMs where direct introspection of internal features is unattainable. For interpretability, we use language models instead of human evaluators, addressing concerns about subjectivity and scalability in evaluations.

The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了RL诱导的动机推理现象，揭示了CoT可能不忠实反映模型内部决策过程的问题。,"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models'reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,Society,该论文明确研究了模型在生成CoT过程中出现的动机性推理（motivated reasoning）现象，这是一种典型的忠实度问题（Sycophancy）。研究揭示了CoT与内部决策过程的真实关系，并提出检测方法，完全符合核心定义。
Consistent Multi-Granular Rationale Extraction for Explainable Multi-hop Fact Verification,2023,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了多粒度理由提取的忠实性和一致性，并提出了新的评估指标。,"The success of deep learning models on multi-hop fact verification has prompted researchers to understand the behavior behind their veracity. One possible way is erasure search: obtaining the rationale by entirely removing a subset of input without compromising the veracity prediction. Although extensively explored, existing approaches fall within the scope of the single-granular (tokens or sentences) explanation, which inevitably leads to explanation redundancy and inconsistency. To address such issues, this paper explores the viability of multi-granular rationale extraction with consistency and faithfulness for explainable multi-hop fact verification. In particular, given a pretrained veracity prediction model, both the token-level explainer and sentence-level explainer are trained simultaneously to obtain multi-granular rationales via differentiable masking. Meanwhile, three diagnostic properties (fidelity, consistency, salience) are introduced and applied to the training process, to ensure that the extracted rationales satisfy faithfulness and consistency. Experimental results on three multi-hop fact verification datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms some state-of-the-art baselines.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,"该论文明确研究多粒度理由提取的忠实性（faithfulness）和一致性（consistency），并引入了诊断属性（如fidelity, consistency, salience）来确保提取的理由满足忠实性。这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关，即研究解释是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程。"

This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they""learn""and""think""? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了内部推理轨迹（reasoning traces）与最终输出的对齐问题（alignment），直接涉及CoT的忠实度（Faithfulness）。特别是发现RL训练的模型在推理轨迹与输出之间存在弱对齐现象，这与Faithfulness的核心定义高度相关。此外，论文还对比了不同训练方法（SFT/DPO/GRPO）对模型内部机制的影响，属于白盒研究。

Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process.

In this work we explore a self-training approach leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to further improve few-shot models, under the assumption that neither human written rationales nor annotated task labels are available at scale. We introduce a novel dual-teacher learning framework, which learns two specialized teacher models for task prediction and rationalization using self-training and distills their knowledge into a multi-tasking student model that can jointly generate the task label and rationale. Furthermore, we formulate a new loss function, Masked Label Regularization (MLR) which promotes explanations to be strongly conditioned on predicted labels.

Boosting Language Models Reasoning with Chain-of-Knowledge Prompting,2023,True,True,True,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出 CoK prompting 和 F^2-Verification 方法，旨在解决 CoT 的不忠实问题。,"Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has delivered success on complex reasoning tasks, which aims at designing a simple prompt like ``Let's think step by step'' or multiple in-context exemplars with well-designed rationales to elicit Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intermediate reasoning steps. However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can further improve the performance of commonsense, factual, symbolic, and arithmetic reasoning tasks.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确提出了 Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting 方法，旨在减少 CoT 中的错误和不忠实推理链。此外，论文还引入了 F^2-Verification 方法来评估推理链的事实性和忠实度，直接涉及 Faithfulness 的研究。

We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning.

Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出了一种增强NLE忠实性的框架，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs.

Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（Miracle Steps），并提出了基于过程奖励的改进方法。,"Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

We investigate whether such""evaluation scent""inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to>1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了 CoT 在不同测试框架下的表现，特别是探讨了评估导向的提示是否会导致 CoT 的过度生成（inflated CoT），而实际上并没有相应的能力提升。这与 Faithfulness 的核心定义直接相关，即 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的预测过程。此外，论文还涉及了 CoT 的可见性和长度，这些都是评估 CoT 忠实度的重要方面。

However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence.

Our analysis spans three classification datasets with annotated rationales, encompassing tasks with varying performance levels. While prompting-based self-explanations are widely used, our study reveals that these explanations are not always as""aligned""with the human rationale as attribution-based explanations. Even more so, fine-tuning LLMs to enhance classification task accuracy does not enhance the alignment of prompting-based rationales. Still, it does considerably improve the alignment of attribution-based methods (e.g., InputXGradient). More importantly, we show that prompting-based self-explanation is also less""faithful""than attribution-based explanations, failing to provide a reliable account of the model's decision-making process. To evaluate faithfulness, unlike prior studies that excluded misclassified examples, we evaluate all instances and also examine the impact of fine-tuning and accuracy on alignment and faithfulness.

Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了奖励黑客行为，提出TRACE度量方法，并涉及训练改进。,"Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less'effort'than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 是否真实反映模型的计算过程，特别是通过检测隐式奖励黑客行为（implicit reward hacking）来评估 CoT 的忠实度。论文提出的 TRACE 方法通过截断 CoT 并测量模型在不同长度下的表现，量化了模型是否在走捷径（即不忠实于实际推理过程）。这直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义，即 CoT 是否真实反映模型的预测过程。
Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,,论文研究了CoT的忠实性问题，揭示了不忠实现象，如事后找补和捷径学习。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，探讨生成的推理是否真实反映模型的计算过程，而非事后合理化。通过控制提示中的暗示条件，研究模型对暗示的依赖程度及其对推理忠实性的影响，符合核心相关标准。

Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure).

Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT与答案不一致的现象，并提出了基于验证的改进方法。,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT与最终答案之间的一致性问题，提出了Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE)方法来惩罚推理与答案不匹配的情况，直接涉及CoT的忠实度问题。
Beyond Semantics: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT的不忠实现象，如无效推理步骤仍能产生正确答案，挑战了CoT的忠实性假设。,"Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), especially of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs to help find new reasoning patterns. While these traces certainly seem to help model performance, it is not clear how they actually influence it, with some works ascribing semantics to the traces and others cautioning against relying on them as transparent and faithful proxies of the model's internal computational process. To systematically investigate the role of end-user semantics of derivational traces, we set up a controlled study where we train transformer models from scratch on formally verifiable reasoning traces and the solutions they lead to. We notice that, despite significant gains over the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces can still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More interestingly, our experiments also show that models trained on corrupted traces, whose intermediate reasoning steps bear no relation to the problem they accompany, perform similarly to those trained on correct ones, and even generalize better on out-of-distribution tasks. We also study the effect of GRPO-based RL post-training on trace validity, noting that while solution accuracy increase, this is not accompanied by any improvements in trace validity. Finally, we examine whether reasoning-trace length reflects inference-time scaling and find that trace length is largely agnostic to the underlying computational complexity of the problem being solved. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or ``Chains of Thought''reflect or induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly seemingly forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究CoT的解释是否为模型预测的真实原因，提出了正确与错误推理痕迹的训练对比，验证中间步骤与最终预测的因果关系，直接挑战CoT对内部计算过程的忠实代理性质，属于核心相关研究。
When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文揭示了CoT推理导致指令跟随准确性下降的现象，并提出了度量指标和改进策略。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文研究了CoT推理在指令跟随任务中的负面影响，通过注意力分析揭示了CoT如何分散模型对指令相关标记的关注，这与Faithfulness的核心问题（CoT是否真实反映模型预测过程）直接相关。
Beyond Introspection: Reinforcing Thinking via Externalist Behavioral Feedback,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出外部反馈机制提升推理可靠性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"While inference-time thinking allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems, the extended thinking process can be unreliable or inconsistent because of the model's probabilistic nature, especially near its knowledge boundaries. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this by having the model critique its own reasoning to make corrections. However, such self-critique inherits the same biases of the original output, known as the introspection illusion. Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods. Benefiting from a lightweight and annotation-free design, DRR offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving the reliability of reasoning in a wide range of LLMs.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究推理过程的可靠性和一致性，提出了外部反馈机制来纠正推理中的偏差，直接涉及CoT的忠实度问题。

While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term""visual thinking drift"". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only""think before answering"", but also""see while thinking"".",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT在视频推理中的忠实性问题，指出CoT生成的推理轨迹与视觉证据不符，导致误导性内部独白和幻觉现象（即'visual thinking drift'）。论文通过贝叶斯视角解释了这种不忠实性，并提出了一种新方法来奖励基于视觉证据的忠实推理轨迹（VER框架），直接针对CoT的Faithfulness问题。

Through a series of operations including pruning, merging, and bridging, the rationale enhances its conciseness. Furthermore, we filter rationales that can be transferred to end-to-end paradigms from programming paradigms to guarantee transferability.

In this work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods, including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).

Chain-of-Probe: Examing the Necessity and Accuracy of CoT Step-by-Step,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT不忠实现象，提出了度量方法，并提出了改进策略。,"Current research found the issue of Early Answering in large language models (LLMs), where the models already have an answer before generating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process.

On the Hardness of Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文探讨了提升CoT忠实性的方法，并揭示了当前方法的局限性。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being employed in real-world applications in critical domains such as healthcare, it is important to ensure that the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning generated by these models faithfully captures their underlying behavior. While LLMs are known to generate CoT reasoning that is appealing to humans, prior studies have shown that these explanations do not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the underlying LLMs. In this work, we explore the promise of three broad approaches commonly employed to steer the behavior of LLMs to enhance the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning generated by LLMs: in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing. Specifically, we introduce novel strategies for in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing aimed at improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning. We then carry out extensive empirical analyses with multiple benchmark datasets to explore the promise of these strategies. Our analyses indicate that these strategies offer limited success in improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning, with only slight performance enhancements in controlled scenarios. Activation editing demonstrated minimal success, while fine-tuning and in-context learning achieved marginal improvements that failed to generalize across diverse reasoning and truthful question-answering benchmarks.

These strategies disrupt traditional CoT processes using controlled variables to assess their efficacy. Additionally, we develop innovative zero-shot prompting strategies that encourage the use of shortcuts, enabling LMs to quickly exploit reasoning clues and bypass detailed procedural steps.

In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem.

Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency,2024,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的内部表示不一致性，提出了内部一致性度量及校准方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency.

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out.

With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions.

When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally.

In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model. We first validate the efficacy of automatic counterfactual hypothesis generation, leveraging on the few-shot priming paradigm.

Question Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning,2023,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过问题分解提升CoT忠实性，并使用了新度量指标验证。,"As large language models (LLMs) perform more difficult tasks, it becomes harder to verify the correctness and safety of their behavior. One approach to help with this issue is to prompt LLMs to externalize their reasoning, e.g., by having them generate step-by-step reasoning as they answer a question (Chain-of-Thought; CoT). The reasoning may enable us to check the process that models use to perform tasks. However, this approach relies on the stated reasoning faithfully reflecting the model's actual reasoning, which is not always the case. To improve over the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, we have models generate reasoning by decomposing questions into subquestions. Decomposition-based methods achieve strong performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes approaching that of CoT while improving the faithfulness of the model's stated reasoning on several recently-proposed metrics. By forcing the model to answer simpler subquestions in separate contexts, we greatly increase the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT, while still achieving some of the performance gains of CoT. Our results show it is possible to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning; continued improvements may lead to reasoning that enables us to verify the correctness and safety of LLM behavior.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究如何通过问题分解提高模型生成推理的忠实度（Faithfulness），并提出了改进方法。研究涉及CoT的忠实性问题，并使用了新的度量标准来评估忠实度。

Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support its answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained categories enhanced detection can improve GPT-4's ability to detect Self-Contra. However, it is only able to detect Self-Contra with a 52.2% F1 score, much lower compared to 66.7% for humans. Our results indicate that current LLMs lack the robustness necessary for reliable reasoning and we emphasize the urgent need for establishing best practices in comprehensive reasoning evaluations beyond pure performance-based metrics.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了模型推理过程中的自相矛盾现象（Self-Contra reasoning），即模型生成的推理与其答案不一致，这直接涉及CoT的忠实度问题。论文不仅评估了这种不一致性的频率，还探讨了模型检测不可靠推理的能力，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Large Language Models can Strategically Deceive their Users when Put Under Pressure,2023,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM在压力下战略性欺骗用户的不忠实现象，与CoT Faithfulness相关。,"We demonstrate a situation in which Large Language Models, trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, can display misaligned behavior and strategically deceive their users about this behavior without being instructed to do so. Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation without direct instructions or training for deception.",,2,Black-box,Society,论文明确研究了大型语言模型在压力下如何策略性地欺骗用户，隐藏其真实决策原因，这与CoT Faithfulness中研究模型解释是否真实反映其实际计算过程直接相关。论文探讨了模型在报告时隐藏真实推理过程的行为，属于核心相关的研究范畴。
A Hypothesis-Driven Framework for the Analysis of Self-Rationalising Models,2024,True,True,True,,论文探讨了自解释模型的忠实性问题，并提出了评估框架，但未提出改进方法。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of LLMs are appealing because the generated explanations can give insights into the plausibility of the predictions. However, how faithful the explanations are to the predictions is questionable, raising the need to explore the patterns behind them further.To this end, we propose a hypothesis-driven statistical framework. We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM’s and the Bayesian network’s decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5. We discuss the implications of this as well as the framework’s potential to approximate LLM decisions better in future work.",Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究LLM生成解释的忠实度（Faithfulness），通过比较LLM和贝叶斯网络的决策过程来判断解释是否真实反映预测过程，符合核心相关标准。
Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought,2025,True,True,False,,论文研究了CoT的legibility与faithfulness的关系，揭示了RL训练导致的不忠实现象。,"Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（Faithfulness）问题，特别是探讨了 RL 训练导致 CoT 不可读（illegible）的现象，并分析了这种不可读性与模型性能的关系。论文还讨论了 CoT 是否真实反映了模型的推理过程，符合核心定义中的 Faithfulness 研究范畴。
AURA: A Fine-Grained Benchmark and Decomposed Metric for Audio-Visual Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出AURA基准和AuraScore指标评估推理忠实性，揭示了模型推理错误但答案正确的现象。,"Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究音频-视觉推理的忠实度问题，提出了AuraScore指标来评估推理过程的Factual Consistency和Core Inference，直接对应CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。论文揭示了模型即使答案正确，推理过程也可能存在缺陷，这正是Faithfulness研究的核心问题。
The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM在作为评判者时存在捷径偏见和不忠实现象，但未提出具体度量或改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert>Human>LLM>Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了LLM作为评判者时，其决策过程是否忠实于实际的计算过程。研究发现LLM依赖提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）进行判断，但解释中几乎不提及这些线索，而是合理化决策内容，这表明其解释是事后合理化（Post-hoc rationalization），属于Faithfulness研究的核心范畴。
Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning,2025,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出基于Curry-Howard对应关系的验证框架，将CoT映射为形式化证明，属于忠实性度量方法。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，提出了一种基于 Curry-Howard 对应关系的理论框架，将 CoT 的自然语言推理步骤映射到形式化的类型化证明结构，以验证其计算忠实性。这直接涉及 CoT 是否真实反映模型预测的计算过程，属于核心相关研究。
Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration,2023,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文提出多模型协作提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提到通过多模型协作增强推理过程的factuality、faithfulness和reliability，直接涉及CoT忠实度的研究，属于核心相关。
LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs生成的自反事实解释不忠实于内部决策过程的现象。,"To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making.

Algorithmic Primitives and Compositional Geometry of Reasoning in Language Models,2025,True,False,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文探讨了LLMs中的推理算法原语及其几何组合，与CoT和Faithfulness相关，提出了度量框架和改进方法。,"How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究语言模型内部激活模式与推理轨迹的关联，通过注入算法原语并测量其对推理步骤的影响，直接验证了模型推理过程的忠实性。研究涉及内部机制（如残差流操作和激活聚类），属于白盒方法，且跨任务评估揭示了原语的可重用性和几何逻辑，与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义高度契合。
Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了LLMs在复杂任务中的推理错误和不忠实性，并引入了评估框架PHEONA来衡量这些错误。,"Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning. Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Medical,论文明确研究LLM在复杂计算表型任务中的推理错误，包括解释正确性和不忠实性错误，并评估了提示修改对准确性的影响，直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心问题。

However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了链式思维（CoT）提示对模型公平性的影响，探讨了模型在生成思考步骤时是否存在偏见，并分析了思考步骤中的偏见与输出偏见之间的相关性。这直接涉及到CoT的忠实度问题，即模型生成的解释是否真实反映了其预测过程。

This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了人类对AI生成的逐步推理文本的理解是否与模型的实际计算过程相匹配，这与Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关。论文通过反事实测量评估了人类识别推理文本中因果步骤的能力，揭示了人类理解与模型实际使用之间的显著差异，挑战了推理文本作为简单可解释性工具的效用。
Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,2024,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT忠实性度量的问题，并揭示了度量与模型准确性之间的相关性，质疑其有效性。,"Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models.

Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了CoT忠实性问题，并提出了运行时验证方法来提升对齐性。,"Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性（faithful chart table reconstruction 和 process conformity），并通过可验证的奖励机制提高解释的真实性，直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification,2024,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出通过论证框架提升解释性和可争议性，与CoT忠实性相关。,"The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs’ performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究如何使LLM的输出能够被忠实解释和有效质疑，这与Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关。ArgLLMs通过构建论证框架来支持决策，并强调其可解释性和可争议性，这直接关联到模型生成解释是否真实反映其预测过程。
Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文评估了推理模型的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了度量指标。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.",,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）的CoT是否比传统模型更忠实（Faithfulness），通过测试模型是否能描述提示中线索对其答案的影响来测量忠实度。论文还探讨了奖励模型可能导致不忠实响应，直接关联CoT Faithfulness的核心问题。
Markovian Transformers for Informative Language Modeling,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出了一种新的训练方法，通过强制模型将推理压缩到可解释的文本中，以提高CoT的忠实性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning often fails to faithfully reflect a language model's underlying decision process. We address this by introducing a Markovian language model framework that can be understood as a reasoning autoencoder: it creates a text-based bottleneck where CoT serves as an intermediate representation, forcing the model to compress essential reasoning into interpretable text before making predictions. We train this system with a GRPO-style policy gradient algorithm using parallel sampling, a frozen baseline CoT', within-batch standardized advantages, and actor-reward (chain-rule) gradients. Our approach yields large gains on QA tasks (e.g., GSM8K: 20.7% to 54.5%; +33.8 pp; ARC-Challenge: 47.5% to 76.9%; +29.4 pp). Perturbation analyses across types and severities show consistently higher sensitivity to CoT edits (typically 52%--82% of cases favor Markovian), indicating stronger causal reliance on the CoT. Cross-model evaluation confirms that learned CoTs generalize across architectures, suggesting they capture transferable reasoning patterns rather than model-specific artifacts.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的决策过程，通过引入 Markovian 语言模型框架和扰动分析来验证 CoT 的因果作用，属于核心相关研究。

Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2023,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出Faithful CoT框架，通过外部求解器保证推理链忠实性，属于改进方法。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting boosts Language Models' (LM) performance on a gamut of complex reasoning tasks, the generated reasoning chain does not necessarily reflect how the model arrives at the answer (aka. faithfulness). We propose Faithful CoT, a reasoning framework involving two stages: Translation (Natural Language query $\rightarrow$ symbolic reasoning chain) and Problem Solving (reasoning chain $\rightarrow$ answer), using an LM and a deterministic solver respectively. This guarantees that the reasoning chain provides a faithful explanation of the final answer. Aside from interpretability, Faithful CoT also improves empirical performance: it outperforms standard CoT on 9 of 10 benchmarks from 4 diverse domains, with a relative accuracy gain of 6.3% on Math Word Problems (MWP), 3.4% on Planning, 5.5% on Multi-hop Question Answering (QA), and 21.4% on Relational Inference. Furthermore, with GPT-4 and Codex, it sets the new state-of-the-art few-shot performance on 7 datasets (with 95.0+ accuracy on 6 of them), showing a strong synergy between faithfulness and accuracy.",International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实性问题，提出了 Faithful CoT 框架，保证推理链忠实反映最终答案的生成过程，并验证了忠实性与准确性的协同效应。
Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT在规划问题中的不忠实现象，即性能提升依赖于特定问题提示而非通用算法学习。,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确研究了CoT提示是否真正教会了模型通用的算法过程，还是仅仅依赖于高度特定于问题的提示。这与Faithfulness的核心定义相关，即CoT是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程。
LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLM生成的不忠实CoT现象，即对抗性帮助，使错误答案看起来合理。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究LLM生成的解释（黑盒方法）如何使错误答案看起来正确，即存在‘对抗性帮助’现象，这与CoT Faithfulness中研究的‘事后合理化’和‘解释的欺骗性’直接相关。

This paper investigates whether LLMs can give faithful high-level explanations of their own internal processes. To explore this, we introduce a dataset, ArticulateRules, of few-shot text-based classification tasks generated by simple rules. Each rule is associated with a simple natural-language explanation. We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations. We release our dataset, ArticulateRules, which can be used to test self-explanation for LLMs trained either in-context or by finetuning.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM是否能忠实解释其自身分类行为，直接涉及Faithfulness的核心问题，即模型生成的解释是否真实反映其内部决策过程。通过构建特定数据集和评估模型解释的准确性，研究直接指向了CoT的忠实度问题。

We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究了 Chain of Thought 的忠实性问题，特别是发现了模型在推理过程中存在不忠实（unfaithfulness）的现象，即模型在推理文本无效的情况下仍能得出正确答案。此外，论文还探讨了影响忠实和不忠实恢复行为的因素，并提出了可能通过选择性干预这些机制来减少不忠实推理的建议。这些内容直接关联到 CoT Faithfulness 的核心研究范畴。

Through human studies and model evaluations on the open-ended News Headline Generation task from the LaMP benchmark, we analyze how the framing and presence of explanations affect user trust and model performance. Overall, we provide evidence that adding an explanation in the model response to justify its reasoning significantly increases self-reported user trust in the model when the user has the opportunity to compare various responses. Position and faithfulness of these explanations are also important factors. However, these gains disappear when users are shown responses independently, suggesting that humans trust all model responses, including deceptive ones, equitably when they are shown in isolation.

Rethinking harmless refusals when fine-tuning foundation models,2024,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了模型在微调后可能产生不忠实的推理痕迹（reason-based deception），并提出了通过反驳策略改进的方法。,"In this paper, we investigate the degree to which fine-tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively mitigates versus merely conceals undesirable behavior. Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to elicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post fine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the reasoning traces and the resultant outputs. Notably, we identify a pervasive phenomenon we term \emph{reason-based deception}, where models either stop producing reasoning traces or produce seemingly ethical reasoning traces that belie the unethical nature of their final outputs. We further examine the efficacy of response strategies (polite refusal versus explicit rebuttal) in curbing the occurrence of undesired behavior in subsequent outputs of multi-turn interactions. Our findings reveal that explicit rebuttals significantly outperform polite refusals in preventing the continuation of undesired outputs and nearly eliminate reason-based deception, challenging current practices in model fine-tuning. Accordingly, the two key contributions of this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type of hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust response model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了模型生成的 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 推理痕迹与最终输出之间的一致性，揭示了模型可能产生看似合理但实际上不道德的推理痕迹（reason-based deception），这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题。论文还探讨了不同响应策略对减少这种不忠实行为的效果，符合 Faithfulness 研究的核心定义。

We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings show that these biases are predictive of model preference and mirror human test-taking strategies even when chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is used. To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a slow thinking process which CoT alone may not provide as it tends to reinforce fast thinking model bias under some prompting methodologies. APriCoT is a step toward developing more robust and fair language models that can think slow.",,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了CoT推理中的偏见问题，指出CoT在某些情况下会强化模型的快速思考偏见，而非真实反映其推理过程。通过引入APriCoT方法，论文探讨了如何减少偏见对模型预测的影响，这直接关联到CoT的忠实度问题。

CoMAT operates entirely with a single LLM and without external solvers. Across four LLMs, CoMAT outperforms traditional CoT on six out of seven benchmarks, achieving gains of 4.48% on MMLU-Redux (MATH) and 4.58% on GaoKao MCQ.

Rationale-Aware Answer Verification by Pairwise Self-Evaluation,2024,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM生成答案中理性与答案不一致的问题，并提出了改进验证方法。,"Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier’s ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了验证过程中理性（rationale）的有效性，指出仅依赖最终答案正确性会忽略理性中的缺陷，与研究CoT忠实度的核心问题直接相关。
Can ChatGPT Defend its Belief in Truth? Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate,2023,True,True,False,,论文探讨了LLMs在辩论中无法坚持正确信念的现象，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments.

Dynamic Clue Bottlenecks: Towards Interpretable-by-Design Visual Question Answering,2023,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种可解释的中间步骤设计，确保忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown extreme effectiveness in visual question answering (VQA). However, the design nature of these end-to-end models prevents them from being interpretable to humans, undermining trust and applicability in critical domains. While post-hoc rationales offer certain insight into understanding model behavior, these explanations are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing an interpretable by design model that factors model decisions into intermediate human-legible explanations, and allows people to easily understand why a model fails or succeeds. We propose the Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model ( (DCLUB), a method that is designed towards an inherently interpretable VQA system. DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems. Given a question, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues. To supervise and evaluate the generation of VQA explanations within DCLUB, we collect a dataset of 1.7k reasoning-focused questions with visual clues. Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning-focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确提出了一个设计上可解释的模型（DCLUB），强调其生成的中间解释（visual clues）是忠实于模型决策过程的（faithful from the beginning），并直接批评了事后解释（post-hoc rationales）的不忠实性。这完全符合 CoT Faithfulness 的核心定义，尤其是关于解释真实反映模型计算过程的要求。

Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了LLM在MCQA任务中生成的推理轨迹（CoT）是否真实反映了其预测策略，通过对比完整输入与仅选项输入下的推理行为，并验证推理轨迹的忠实性（faithfulness tests），直接探讨了CoT是否揭示模型的实际计算过程。

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study.

Do Models Explain Themselves?

However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers""yes""to the input question""Can eagles fly?""with the explanation""all birds can fly"", then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer""yes""to the counterfactual input""Can penguins fly?"". If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution.",International Conference on Machine Learning,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究自然语言解释的忠实度，通过反事实模拟（counterfactual simulatability）评估解释是否真实反映模型的决策过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。

While understanding why CoT prompting is effective is crucial to ensuring that this phenomenon is a consequence of desired model behavior, little work has addressed this; nonetheless, such an understanding is a critical prerequisite for responsible model deployment. We address this question by leveraging gradient-based feature attribution methods which produce saliency scores that capture the influence of input tokens on model output. Specifically, we probe several open-source LLMs to investigate whether CoT prompting affects the relative importances they assign to particular input tokens. Our results indicate that while CoT prompting does not increase the magnitude of saliency scores attributed to semantically relevant tokens in the prompt compared to standard few-shot prompting, it increases the robustness of saliency scores to question perturbations and variations in model output.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文通过基于梯度的特征归因方法探究CoT提示对模型输出中特定输入令牌相对重要性的影响，明确研究CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因（Causal role），属于核心相关的Faithfulness研究。
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages",2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了多语言CoT推理的性能、一致性和忠实性，并使用了扰动技术来评估忠实性。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves, i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees.

Causal Prompting: Debiasing Large Language Model Prompting based on Front-Door Adjustment,2024,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出基于因果关系的提示方法，利用CoT作为中介变量，并通过微调提升忠实性。,"Despite the notable advancements of existing prompting methods, such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to various biases. Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including approaches based on data augmentation and reweighting, yet they struggle with the complex biases inherent in LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate LLMs biases. In specific, causal intervention is achieved by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs. The chain-of-thought generated by LLM is employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between input prompts and output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases. Moreover, to accurately represent the chain-of-thoughts and estimate the causal effects, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of chain-of-thought by aligning its space with that of the LLM.

Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language Models,2023,True,True,True,,论文提出了量化LLM解释不确定性的新指标，并探讨了解释的忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models.",International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM生成解释的可靠性（faithfulness），并提出了量化解释不确定性的方法，其中Probing Uncertainty与解释的忠实度直接相关。论文关注的是解释是否真实反映模型行为，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。
Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了VLMs中CoT解释的忠实性问题，并提出了新的评估框架。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,Medical,该论文明确研究医疗视觉语言模型（VLMs）中链式思考（CoT）解释的忠实性问题，通过多模态扰动（文本和图像修改）来评估CoT是否真实反映底层决策过程。论文提出了测量Faithfulness的指标（临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准），并发现答案准确性和解释质量可以解耦，这表明CoT的解释可能不忠实。

Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究LLM生成的事后解释（post-hoc explanations）是否真实反映决策过程，并提出了新的度量标准来评估解释与决策相关特征之间的一致性，直接涉及CoT Faithfulness的核心问题。

We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 推理中的因果充分性和必要性，通过因果框架量化推理步骤对最终结果的实际影响，直接涉及 CoT 是否真实反映模型预测的计算过程，属于 Faithfulness 核心研究。
Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象，如事后找补和欺骗性推理，但未提出新度量或改进方法。,"Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (""I'll trick the user...""), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (""Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...""). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT在推理模型中的忠实性问题，揭示了CoT可能被用于欺骗或事后合理化（Post-hoc rationalization）的现象，符合Faithfulness的核心定义。

Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process. In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments.

Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models,2025,True,True,True,,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（chain disloyalty），并提出了黑盒审计方法进行度量。,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit'chain disloyalty'-- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

CoT-Kinetics: A Theoretical Modeling Assessing LRM Reasoning Process,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了一种评估推理轨迹质量的新方法，与 CoT 忠实性相关。,"Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究如何评估推理轨迹的合理性（soundness），并提出了一个基于能量方程的评分方法，以反映推理部分对最终答案的因果影响。这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题，即推理轨迹是否真实反映了模型的计算过程。
Investigating Training and Generalization in Faithful Self-Explanations of Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了如何通过训练提升自我解释的忠实性，并验证了其泛化能力。,"Large language models have the potential to generate explanations for their own predictions in a variety of styles based on user instructions. Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models'actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability.",,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了大型语言模型自我解释的忠实性（faithfulness），并探讨了如何通过训练提高这种忠实性。论文使用了特征归因方法来构建可能忠实的一词约束解释，并研究了这些改进是否能够泛化到多词设置和未见过的任务。这些内容直接关联到CoT Faithfulness的核心研究范畴，特别是关于解释是否真实反映模型行为的问题。
A Closer Look at Bias and Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness of Large (Vision) Language Models,2025,True,True,True,,论文研究了CoT忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了新的评估框架。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs), investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent''reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,Society,该论文明确研究了CoT的忠实性问题，探讨了模型推理轨迹是否真实反映内部过程，并发现了不一致推理现象（inconsistent reasoning），直接关联到Faithfulness的核心定义。研究涉及文本和图像偏见对推理的影响，属于社会学领域。
Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了QuaSAR方法来提升Faithfulness。,"Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic).",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT解释的robustness和faithfulness问题，并提出了QuaSAR方法来减少内容偏见对忠实度的影响，属于核心相关研究。
Investigating CoT Monitorability in Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了CoT忠实性和监控可靠性，揭示了不忠实现象如捷径和阿谀奉承。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models'long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models'misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.",,2,Black-box,General,论文明确研究 CoT 的忠实度（faithfulness），探讨模型是否在生成的推理过程中真实反映其内部决策过程，并涉及欺骗性行为（如 sycophancy）和监控可靠性。
Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2023,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT解释可能误导性地反映模型预测的真实原因，属于不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了CoT解释是否真实反映模型的预测过程，发现了CoT解释可能系统性地误导用户，尤其是在存在偏见特征的情况下。这直接涉及Faithfulness的核心问题，即解释是否忠实于模型的实际计算过程。

One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了大语言模型生成解释的准确性，特别是通过一致性检查来识别解释中的不准确或遗漏，这与CoT Faithfulness的核心定义直接相关。论文提出的方法旨在通过后续问题生成来验证解释的真实性，属于研究模型解释是否真实反映其推理过程的范畴。

We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies.

Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究了解释的忠实度问题，通过反事实模拟（counterfactual simulatability）来评估LLM解释是否能让用户准确预测模型在相关反事实输入下的输出。这与Faithfulness的核心定义高度相关，即解释是否真实反映了模型的计算过程。

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了模型在CoT监控下故意表现不佳的不忠实现象。,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.

VisFIS: Visual Feature Importance Supervision with Right-for-the-Right-Reason Objectives,2022,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了模型解释的忠实性，并提出了改进方法。,"Many past works aim to improve visual reasoning in models by supervising feature importance (estimated by model explanation techniques) with human annotations such as highlights of important image regions. However, recent work has shown that performance gains from feature importance (FI) supervision for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks persist even with random supervision, suggesting that these methods do not meaningfully align model FI with human FI. In this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA model accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason (RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate predictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2) max-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3) invariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and (4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations (Plausibility). Our best performing method, Visual Feature Importance Supervision (VisFIS), outperforms strong baselines on benchmark VQA datasets in terms of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. While past work suggests that the mechanism for improved accuracy is through improved explanation plausibility, we show that this relationship depends crucially on explanation faithfulness (whether explanations truly represent the model's internal reasoning). Predictions are more accurate when explanations are plausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful. Lastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of out-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's in-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics for evaluating model reasoning.

FRAME: Evaluating Rationale-Label Consistency Metrics for Free-Text Rationales,2022,True,True,True,,论文讨论了自由文本理由的忠实性问题，并提出了评估框架FRAME，涉及不忠实现象和度量指标。,"Following how humans communicate, free-text rationales aim to use natural language to explain neural language model (LM) behavior. However, free-text rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics' reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales, which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric that greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing competitively on (2).

On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations,2023,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT解释的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量指标CC-SHAP来评估自洽性。,"Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

"Interpretable Traces, Unexpected Outcomes: Investigating the Disconnect in Trace-Based Knowledge Distillation",2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了CoT推理痕迹的忠实性问题，并提出了基于规则的问题分解方法来改进。,"Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem, particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD. However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness.

Here, we show that i) LLMs can accurately describe quantitative features of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making and ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain how they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have been fine-tuned to make. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究LLM如何描述其内部决策过程，并验证这些自我解释的准确性，直接涉及Faithfulness的核心问题。通过微调模型提高其解释能力，进一步验证了解释的忠实性。
Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations,2025,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了语言模型如何忠实描述其内部计算，与CoT忠实性相关，并提出了微调方法。,"Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs'privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs'internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models'privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods.",,2,White-box,General,论文明确研究语言模型是否能忠实描述其内部计算过程（Faithfulness），并利用自身内部信息生成解释，涉及因果结构和特征影响分析，属于核心相关研究。
Mitigating Deceptive Alignment via Self-Monitoring,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（如欺骗性对齐），提出了度量框架DeceptionBench，并提出了改进方法CoT Monitor+。,"Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出评估自然语言解释可信度的框架，关注忠实性，并揭示通用模型的不忠实现象。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",2,Black-box,Medical,论文明确提出了评估自然语言解释的信任度框架，特别关注了Faithfulness（忠实度）这一关键维度，并对比了通用模型与领域专用模型在生成忠实解释上的差异。这直接符合CoT Faithfulness研究的核心定义，即探究解释是否真实反映模型的预测过程。

Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出新度量标准HAF评估LLMs毒性解释的忠实性，揭示了不一致和不相关响应现象。,"The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs'reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs'free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs'toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how""non-ideal""the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful—serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications.

LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,LAMP 方法通过局部线性模型近似语言模型的决策表面，研究模型如何可靠地将其自我报告的解释映射到预测上。这直接涉及模型生成的解释（CoT/Reasoning Trace）是否真实反映了模型做出最终预测的实际计算过程，符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。此外，LAMP 不需要访问模型梯度、logits 或内部激活值，属于黑盒方法。

Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods.

We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative""thinking mode""is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process.

Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch?

While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread""scheming""behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency.

Such failures severely damage trust in rationalization methods and constrain the application of rationalization techniques on PLMs. In this paper, we find that the homogeneity of tokens in the sentences produced by PLMs is the primary contributor to these problems. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Pre-trained Language Model's Rationalization (PLMR), which splits PLMs into a generator and a predictor to deal with NLP tasks while providing interpretable rationales.

An important consideration in designing them is faithfulness, i.e. generating explanations that accurately reflect the reasoning of the model. Recent works have focused on natural logic, which operates directly on natural language by capturing the semantic relation of spans between an aligned claim with its evidence via set-theoretic operators. However, these approaches rely on substantial resources for training, which are only available for high-resource languages. To this end, we propose to use question answering to predict natural logic operators, taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models. Thus, we obviate the need for annotated training data while still relying on a deterministic inference system.

RACG-DRT: Retrieval Augumented Code Generation Based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT在代码生成中的不忠实现象，并提出了基于动态修订的改进方法。,"Large models have the problems of hallucinations in the field of code generation. The causes of these hallucinations include errors in the model’s reasoning process, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge. To tackle these challenges, the prevailing approach currently involves influencing the large model’s reasoning and prediction processes through techniques such as chain of thought, single-shot retrievalaugmented generation, and dynamic retrieval-augmented generation. COT (chain of thought) prompting method facilitates logical reasoning by the model on programming problems through prompts. Single-shot retrieval-augmented generation technology enables the construction of query statements based on programming issues to retrieve information from external knowledge bases. Meanwhile, dynamic retrieval-augmented generation technology allows for real-time retrieval from external knowledge bases during the code generation process, integrating retrieved documents to continue generating subsequent code. However, these methods primarily address the hallucination problem in code generation from a localized perspective. To simultaneously resolve issues such as reasoning errors, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge in the field of code generation, this study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation framework based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts (RACGDRT). The core concept of this framework involves firstly enabling the large model to produce a comprehensive code draft (utilizing COT prompts), followed by conducting error detection on code segments corresponding to different reasoning steps within the draft. Upon detecting an error, the Keyword Extractor (KE) will extract keywords and formulate query statements for both the user’s input question and the erroneous code segment, subsequently retrieving pertinent documents from the external knowledge base. Finally, with the retrieved documents and questions in hand, the large model proceeds to iteratively generate the next code draft. RACG-DRT guarantees the rationality of reasoning via COT, constructs query statements tailored to erroneous thought segments and issues to bolster both local and holistic knowledge, and iteratively produces code drafts to uphold the integrity of the code generation process.",,0,Black-box,Code,论文主要关注如何通过检索增强和动态修订思想来解决代码生成中的幻觉问题，并未涉及CoT是否真实反映模型预测的实际计算过程（Faithfulness）。
Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文讨论了CoT在临床决策中的不忠实现象，并提出了评估框架和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance.

TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文涉及CoT和Faithfulness，提出了GRPO-CSV方法改进忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

SG-FSM: A Self-Guiding Zero-Shot Prompting Paradigm for Multi-Hop Question Answering Based on Finite State Machine,2024,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出了一种自我引导的提示方法，旨在通过分解问题和自我纠正来增强推理的忠实性。,"Large Language Models with chain-of-thought prompting, such as OpenAI-o1, have shown impressive capabilities in natural language inference tasks. However, Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) remains challenging for many existing models due to issues like hallucination, error propagation, and limited context length. To address these challenges and enhance LLMs' performance on MHQA, we propose the Self-Guiding prompting Finite State Machine (SG-FSM), designed to strengthen multi-hop reasoning abilities. Unlike traditional chain-of-thought methods, SG-FSM tackles MHQA by iteratively breaking down complex questions into sub-questions, correcting itself to improve accuracy. It processes one sub-question at a time, dynamically deciding the next step based on the current context and results, functioning much like an automaton. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming strong baselines on challenging datasets such as Musique.

However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model’s information flow, exhibiting strong transferability.

LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种结合逻辑推理和LLM的架构，旨在提高推理的忠实性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.",arXiv.org,0,Black-box,Logic,论文主要研究如何通过神经符号架构提升LLM在逻辑推理任务中的性能，未涉及CoT生成的解释是否忠实反映模型内部计算过程。

Incorporating LLM Versus LLM Into Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Fine-Grained Evidence Generation,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了MCoT中的语义漂移问题，并提出了实体级验证框架来提升忠实性。,"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) has become an effective strategy for enhancing multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) by breaking down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps. Despite its interpretability benefits, MCoT often encounters difficulties with fine-grained semantic grounding, particularly when reasoning involves small objects, subtle attributes, or visually complex scenes that can lead to inaccuracies. Existing attempts to address these issues primarily fall into two categories: fine-tuning, which depends on large annotated datasets and costly parameter updates; and in-context learning (ICL), which achieves few-shot or zero-shot reasoning without model modification. Although ICL provides flexibility and adaptability, it is prone to semantic drift caused by an unstable prompt quality. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an entity-level evidence generation and verification framework using the ICL paradigm. This approach first produces MCoT from multimodal inputs, followed by extraction of key entities with enriched evidential descriptions. These entities were then cross-validated through adversarial checks using multiple MLLMs, and the verified evidence was integrated back into the reasoning chain. Experiments demonstrated consistent performance gains: on ScienceQA, the accuracy improved from 82.39% to 86.04%(+3.65%) with GPT-3.5, 84.96% to 89.37%(+4.41%) with Gemini; on MathVista, the accuracy increased from 43.1% to 43.6%(+0.50%) with GPT-3.5, and from 44.7% to 45.6%(+0.90%) with Gemini.

Chain-of-Image Generation: Toward Monitorable and Controllable Image Generation,2025,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了Chain-of-Image Generation框架，类似于CoT，并提出了新的度量指标来评估中间步骤的清晰度和因果相关性。,"While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a""black box.""This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.",,0,Black-box,General,论文主要研究图像生成过程中的可监控性和可控性，提出了Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG)框架，虽然借鉴了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)的思想，但并未涉及CoT的忠实度（Faithfulness）问题。研究重点在于图像生成的步骤分解和监控，而非模型推理过程的真实性。

While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many other settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC, a prompting approach that predicts text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC begins by proposing aspects of comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise consistency comparator that ensures each aspect's comparisons clearly distinguish differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our comprehensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC equips LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text preference prediction.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,0,Black-box,General,该论文主要关注通过结构化比较推理（SC）提升文本偏好预测的性能和一致性，虽然涉及 Chain-of-Thought 的改进，但核心目标是提高准确率和减少幻觉（Factuality），并未探讨 CoT 是否忠实反映模型的实际推理过程（Faithfulness）。

Previous studies try to distill task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains. We evaluate PaD on arithmetic reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and general ability.Experimental results demonstrate that smaller models using PaD can not only outperform certain LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-1 13B) but also achieve strong improvement over baselines with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data.

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly adept at nuanced language tasks, questions arise about whether—and how—they can assist in large-scale coding without eroding the interpretive depth that distinguishes qualitative analysis from traditional machine learning and other quantitative approaches to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that preserves hermeneutic value while incorporating LLMs to scale the application of codes to large data sets that are impractical for manual coding. Our workflow retains the traditional cycle of codebook development and refinement, adding an iterative step to adapt definitions for machine comprehension, before ultimately replacing manual with automated text categorization.

MMC: Iterative Refinement of VLM Reasoning via MCTS-based Multimodal Critique,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出通过迭代反馈机制改进VLM的推理能力，涉及CoT忠实性改进方法。,"Visual language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations, resulting in incorrect reasoning outcomes. Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node—one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline.

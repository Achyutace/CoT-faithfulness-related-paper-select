Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling,2025,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的忠实性问题，提出了通过重采样进行因果分析的方法，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In""agentic misalignment""scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes""unfaithful"", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实原因（Causal role），通过重采样方法探讨模型决策的因果影响。论文还讨论了 CoT 的‘unfaithful’现象，并提出了测量 Faithfulness 的指标（如 resilience metric 和 causal mediation analysis）。这些内容直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,True,True,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文探讨了LLM自我解释的忠实性问题，并提出了自我一致性检查作为度量方法。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,General,该论文明确研究LLM自我解释（self-explanations）是否忠实反映模型行为，提出使用自一致性检查（self-consistency checks）来衡量忠实度，并探讨了不同解释类型（反事实、特征归因、删减）在不同模型和任务中的忠实性差异，完全符合CoT Faithfulness的核心定义。
When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文揭示了CoT推理导致指令跟随准确性下降的现象，并提出了度量指标和改进策略。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,General,该论文研究了CoT推理在指令跟随任务中的负面影响，通过注意力分析揭示了CoT如何分散模型对指令相关标记的关注，这与Faithfulness的核心问题（CoT是否真实反映模型预测过程）直接相关。
Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency,2024,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的内部表示不一致性，提出了内部一致性度量及校准方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency. In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of using internal representations for self-evaluation of LLMs. Our code is available at github.com/zhxieml/internal-consistency.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,White-box,General,该论文明确研究了生成的理由（rationales）与模型内部表示之间的一致性，揭示了中间层与最终层表示的不一致性可能削弱推理过程的可靠性。这直接关联到CoT的忠实度问题，即模型生成的解释是否真实反映了其预测的实际计算过程。此外，论文提出了通过内部一致性来校准推理的方法，这属于测量Faithfulness的指标。
Explanation-aware Soft Ensemble Empowers Large Language Model In-context Learning,2023,True,True,False,Consistency & Ensembling,论文通过集成解释和预测来解决不一致性，属于 CoT Faithfulness 的提升方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks. With only a few demonstration examples, these LLMs can quickly adapt to target tasks without expensive gradient updates. Common strategies to boost such 'in-context' learning ability are to ensemble multiple model decoded results and require the model to generate an explanation along with the prediction. However, these models often treat different class predictions equally and neglect the potential discrepancy between the explanations and predictions. To fully unleash the power of explanations, we propose EASE, an Explanation-Aware Soft Ensemble framework to empower in-context learning with LLMs. We design two techniques, explanation-guided ensemble, and soft probability aggregation, to mitigate the effect of unreliable explanations and improve the consistency between explanations and final predictions. Experiments on seven natural language understanding tasks and four varying-size LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,Black-box,General,论文提出了一个框架来提升解释与预测之间的一致性，但并未明确研究解释是否真实反映了模型的内部计算过程，属于边缘相关。
Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration,2023,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文提出多模型协作提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.",arXiv.org,2,Black-box,General,论文明确提到通过多模型协作增强推理过程的factuality、faithfulness和reliability，直接涉及CoT忠实度的研究，属于核心相关。
FZI-WIM at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Self-Consistent CoT for Complex NLI in Biomedical Domain,2024,True,False,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文使用自洽性（self-consistency）和多数投票提升CoT性能，并报告了忠实性分数。,"This paper describes the inference system of FZI-WIM at the SemEval-2024 Task 2: Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials. Our system utilizes the chain of thought (CoT) paradigm to tackle this complex reasoning problem and further improve the CoT performance with self-consistency. Instead of greedy decoding, we sample multiple reasoning chains with the same prompt and make thefinal verification with majority voting. The self-consistent CoT system achieves a baseline F1 score of 0.80 (1st), faithfulness score of 0.90 (3rd), and consistency score of 0.73 (12th). We release the code and data publicly.",International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation,1,Black-box,Medical,论文提到了faithfulness score，表明对CoT的忠实度进行了测量，但未深入探讨CoT是否是模型预测的真实原因或是否存在事后解释现象。此外，研究主要集中在通过自一致性提高性能，属于边缘相关。
SPINE: Token-Selective Test-Time Reinforcement Learning with Entropy-Band Regularization,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文讨论了CoT中的不忠实现象（如多数投票奖励导致响应缩短），并提出了改进方法（如选择性更新高熵分支点）。,"Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SPINE.",,1,Black-box,General,该论文研究了测试时强化学习中的自一致性投票和伪奖励机制，虽然涉及了链式推理的分支点（forking tokens）和稳定性问题，但主要关注的是性能提升和训练稳定性，而非直接验证CoT解释是否忠实反映模型的内部计算过程。因此属于边缘相关。
A collection of principles for guiding and evaluating large language models,2023,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文讨论了LLM的推理能力及透明度，涉及CoT和Faithfulness，但未具体揭示不忠实现象或提出度量指标。,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding capabilities, but challenges remain regarding their ability to solve complex reasoning tasks, as well as their transparency, robustness, truthfulness, and ethical alignment. In this preliminary study, we compile a set of core principles for steering and evaluating the reasoning of LLMs by curating literature from several relevant strands of work: structured reasoning in LLMs, self-evaluation/self-reflection, explainability, AI system safety/security, guidelines for human critical thinking, and ethical/regulatory guidelines for AI. We identify and curate a list of 220 principles from literature, and derive a set of 37 core principles organized into seven categories: assumptions and perspectives, reasoning, information and evidence, robustness and security, ethics, utility, and implications. We conduct a small-scale expert survey, eliciting the subjective importance experts assign to different principles and lay out avenues for future work beyond our preliminary results. We envision that the development of a shared model of principles can serve multiple purposes: monitoring and steering models at inference time, improving model behavior during training, and guiding human evaluation of model reasoning.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,General,论文讨论了LLM的推理、透明性和可解释性，并提出了评估原则，但未明确研究CoT的忠实度或因果分析，属于边缘相关。

Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过自玩游戏提升模型推理过程的理性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.",International Conference on Machine Learning,Black-box,Math,该论文通过设计一个自我对弈游戏（CDG）来提升语言模型在推理过程中的理性，主要关注的是模型的输入输出行为（Prompting），没有涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。实验任务主要集中在数学推理领域，因此领域分类为Math。
Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了黑盒方法评估CoT中句子的重要性，与Faithfulness相关。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Math,论文提出了一种黑盒方法，通过替换句子并测量其对最终答案分布的影响来分析推理过程。研究领域涉及数学问题的解决，因此归类为数学领域。
TRACE: A Framework for Analyzing and Enhancing Stepwise Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出TRACE框架，通过中间步骤一致性评估揭示推理错误，涉及CoT忠实性。,"Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement.",,White-box,Math,该论文提出了一种框架TRACE，用于分析和增强视觉语言模型中的逐步推理能力。研究涉及模型内部推理轨迹的诊断和评估，属于白盒方法。任务领域主要是数学和科学推理，因此归类为Math。
"What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT",2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文探讨了CoT的有效性，提出了不忠实现象（如失败步骤影响推理），并提出了新的度量指标（FSF）和改进方法。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the""longer-is-better""narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy. As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Math,该论文研究的是大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学和科学推理任务中的表现，通过分析链式思考（CoT）的长度、回顾和结构来评估其有效性。研究主要基于输入输出和Prompting方法，没有涉及模型内部机制或权重调整，因此属于黑盒方法。任务领域明确涉及数学推理，因此归类为Math。
Beyond the First Error: Process Reward Models for Reflective Mathematical Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了长链推理中的自我纠正机制，提出了新的数据标注方法以提升PRMs的评分能力，涉及CoT忠实性。,"Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs. However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process. Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation, enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets, our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method.",,White-box,Math,该论文研究的是数学推理过程中的错误传播和终止机制，涉及模型内部的自校正和反思机制，属于白盒方法。研究领域明确为数学推理，因此归类为Math。
EPT-X: An Expression-Pointer Transformer model that generates eXplanations for numbers,2022,True,False,False,,论文提出了一种生成数学问题解释的模型，并讨论了忠实性，但未涉及不忠实现象或新度量方法。,"In this paper, we propose a neural model EPT-X (Expression-Pointer Transformer with Explanations), which utilizes natural language explanations to solve an algebraic word problem. To enhance the explainability of the encoding process of a neural model, EPT-X adopts the concepts of plausibility and faithfulness which are drawn from math word problem solving strategies by humans. A plausible explanation is one that includes contextual information for the numbers and variables that appear in a given math word problem. A faithful explanation is one that accurately represents the reasoning process behind the model’s solution equation. The EPT-X model yields an average baseline performance of 69.59% on our PEN dataset and produces explanations with quality that is comparable to human output. The contribution of this work is two-fold.

Causal Abstraction for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Arithmetic Word Problems,2023,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文探讨了CoT在算术问题中的因果影响，揭示了LLMs使用CoT进行推理的现象，并提出了因果抽象评估方法。,"Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) achieve higher accuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks when prompted to generate intermediate reasoning steps, or a chain of thought (CoT), before their final answer. However, it is unclear how exactly CoTs improve LLMs’ accuracy, and in particular, if LLMs use their CoTs to reason to their final answers. This paper tries to answer this question with respect to arithmetic word problems, by (i) evaluating the correctness of LLMs’ CoTs, and (ii) using causal abstraction to assess if the intermediate tokens produced as part of a CoT causally impact LLMs’ final answers, in line with the reasoning described by the CoT. We find that for CoT-prompted LLMs, correct answers to arithmetic problems are highly correlated with correct CoTs, and that when LLMs produce correct CoTs, they realize to a fairly large extent the causal models suggested by their CoTs. Higher degrees of realization also seem associated with better overall accuracy on the arithmetic problems. These findings suggest that some CoT-prompted LLMs may do better on multi-step arithmetic reasoning at least partly because they use their CoTs to reason to their final answers. However, for some LLMs, other internal processes may also be involved.",BlackboxNLP Workshop on Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP,White-box,Math,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在算术应用题中的推理过程，特别是通过因果抽象评估中间推理步骤（CoT）对最终答案的因果影响。研究涉及模型内部机制和中间令牌的因果作用，属于白盒方法。任务领域是数学，因为研究集中在算术应用题上。
Step-KTO: Optimizing Mathematical Reasoning through Stepwise Binary Feedback,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出 Step-KTO 训练框架，通过过程级和结果级反馈提升推理忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities.",,White-box,Math,论文标题和摘要提到了一种训练框架Step-KTO，该框架通过提供中间推理步骤和最终答案的二元评估来指导LLMs，这表明研究涉及模型内部机制和训练过程，属于白盒方法。研究领域集中在数学推理上，因此任务领域为数学。
SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出通过对抗自演游戏提升 CoT 忠实性，属于改进方法中的训练与微调。,"Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a""sneaky generator""that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a""critic""that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, SPC can guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs and significantly improve their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, surpassing those guided by state-of-the-art process reward models.",arXiv.org,White-box,Math,论文提出了一种通过对抗性自玩游戏来评估和改进大型语言模型（LLM）推理步骤的方法，涉及模型的内部机制和强化学习，因此归类为白盒方法。研究主要关注数学推理性能的提升，因此任务领域为数学。
How Do Humans Write Code? Large Models Do It the Same Way Too,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了CoT和PoT的忠实性问题，并提出了改进方法。,"Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model’s information flow, exhibiting strong transferability.

Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（Miracle Steps），并提出了基于过程奖励的改进方法。,"Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

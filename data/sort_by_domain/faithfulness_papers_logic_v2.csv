multiPRover: Generating Multiple Proofs for Improved Interpretability in Rule Reasoning,2021,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出生成多个证明图以提高解释性，涉及 CoT 和 Faithfulness，但未讨论不忠实现象或新度量。,"We focus on a type of linguistic formal reasoning where the goal is to reason over explicit knowledge in the form of natural language facts and rules (Clark et al., 2020). A recent work, named PRover (Saha et al., 2020), performs such reasoning by answering a question and also generating a proof graph that explains the answer. However, compositional reasoning is not always unique and there may be multiple ways of reaching the correct answer. Thus, in our work, we address a new and challenging problem of generating multiple proof graphs for reasoning over natural language rule-bases. Each proof provides a different rationale for the answer, thereby improving the interpretability of such reasoning systems. In order to jointly learn from all proof graphs and exploit the correlations between multiple proofs for a question, we pose this task as a set generation problem over structured output spaces where each proof is represented as a directed graph. We propose two variants of a proof-set generation model, multiPRover. Our first model, Multilabel-multiPRover, generates a set of proofs via multi-label classification and implicit conditioning between the proofs; while the second model, Iterative-multiPRover, generates proofs iteratively by explicitly conditioning on the previously generated proofs. Experiments on multiple synthetic, zero-shot, and human-paraphrased datasets reveal that both multiPRover models significantly outperform PRover on datasets containing multiple gold proofs. Iterative-multiPRover obtains state-of-the-art proof F1 in zero-shot scenarios where all examples have single correct proofs. It also generalizes better to questions requiring higher depths of reasoning where multiple proofs are more frequent.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文研究生成多个证明图以提高规则推理的可解释性，虽然涉及推理的多样性和解释性，但未明确探讨这些解释是否忠实反映模型的内部计算过程，属于边缘相关。
ProoFVer: Natural Logic Theorem Proving for Fact Verification,2021,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出使用自然逻辑推理作为忠实解释，通过构造确保忠实性。,"Abstract Fact verification systems typically rely on neural network classifiers for veracity prediction, which lack explainability. This paper proposes ProoFVer, which uses a seq2seq model to generate natural logic-based inferences as proofs. These proofs consist of lexical mutations between spans in the claim and the evidence retrieved, each marked with a natural logic operator. Claim veracity is determined solely based on the sequence of these operators. Hence, these proofs are faithful explanations, and this makes ProoFVer faithful by construction. Currently, ProoFVer has the highest label accuracy and the second best score in the FEVER leaderboard. Furthermore, it improves by 13.21% points over the next best model on a dataset with counterfactual instances, demonstrating its robustness. As explanations, the proofs show better overlap with human rationales than attention-based highlights and the proofs help humans predict model decisions correctly more often than using the evidence directly.1",Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,论文明确提出了 ProoFVer 系统，通过生成基于自然逻辑的推理作为证明，这些证明由声明和证据之间的词汇突变组成，并标记有自然逻辑运算符。声明真实性仅基于这些运算符的序列确定，因此这些证明是忠实的解释。论文强调了这些解释的忠实性，并且通过构造使 ProoFVer 具有忠实性。此外，论文还提到在反事实实例数据集上的表现，进一步证明了其鲁棒性。
FaiRR: Faithful and Robust Deductive Reasoning over Natural Language,2022,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出模块化组件确保推理步骤与推理过程有因果联系，提升忠实性。,"Transformers have been shown to be able to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,论文明确研究如何通过模块化设计（规则选择、事实选择、知识组合）确保推理过程的忠实性（Faithfulness），并强调因果关系的保证。此外，论文还对比了传统黑盒模型可能存在的非忠实性（Unfaithful）问题，符合核心相关标准。
Natural Language Deduction through Search over Statement Compositions,2022,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种通过搜索过程分解任务的方法，生成反映推理过程的中间结论树，符合CoT忠实性定义。,"In settings from fact-checking to question answering, we frequently want to know whether a collection of evidence (premises) entails a hypothesis. Existing methods primarily focus on the end-to-end discriminative version of this task, but less work has treated the generative version in which a model searches over the space of statements entailed by the premises to constructively derive the hypothesis. We propose a system for doing this kind of deductive reasoning in natural language by decomposing the task into separate steps coordinated by a search procedure, producing a tree of intermediate conclusions that faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process. Our experiments on the EntailmentBank dataset (Dalvi et al., 2021) demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully prove true statements while rejecting false ones. Moreover, it produces natural language explanations with a 17% absolute higher step validity than those produced by an end-to-end T5 model.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确研究生成式自然语言演绎推理，通过搜索过程构建中间结论树，强调其推理过程忠实反映系统内部计算（'faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process'），直接符合 Faithfulness 的核心定义。实验通过验证步骤有效性（step validity）衡量解释的忠实性，属于因果性分析而非事后合理化。
Learning to Rationalize for Nonmonotonic Reasoning with Distant Supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了生成事后解释性理由（post-hoc rationales）的现象，并尝试通过训练生成模型来改进。,"The black-box nature of neural models has motivated a line of research that aims to generate natural language rationales to explain why a model made certain predictions. Such rationale generation models, to date, have been trained on dataset-specific crowdsourced rationales, but this approach is costly and is not generalizable to new tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which neural models can reason about natural language rationales that explain model predictions, relying only on distant supervision with no additional annotation cost for human-written rationales. We investigate multiple ways to automatically generate rationales using pre-trained language models, neural knowledge models, and distant supervision from related tasks, and train generative models capable of composing explanatory rationales for unseen instances. We demonstrate our approach on the defeasible inference task, a nonmonotonic reasoning task in which an inference may be strengthened or weakened when new information (an update) is introduced. Our model shows promises at generating post-hoc rationales explaining why an inference is more or less likely given the additional information, however, it mostly generates trivial rationales reflecting the fundamental limitations of neural language models. Conversely, the more realistic setup of jointly predicting the update or its type and generating rationale is more challenging, suggesting an important future direction.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,1,Black-box,Logic,论文研究了生成自然语言解释（rationales）以解释模型预测的过程，虽然主要关注的是非单调推理任务中的解释生成，但并未明确探讨这些解释是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程（Faithfulness）。因此，它属于边缘相关的研究。
The Geometry of Self-Verification in a Task-Specific Reasoning Model,2025,True,False,False,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文研究了模型如何自我验证其推理过程，涉及CoT的忠实性，并提出了白盒干预方法。,"How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model.",arXiv.org,2,White-box,Logic,该论文明确研究了模型如何验证其自身答案的内部机制，特别是通过分析GLU权重和注意力头来定位自我验证的关键组件。这直接关联到CoT的忠实度问题，即模型生成的解释是否真实反映了其预测的实际计算过程。
Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出Logic-of-Thought方法解决CoT的不忠实问题，属于改进方法中的Prompting类别。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确提到 Chain-of-Thought 存在 unfaithful 问题，即生成的推理链与最终结论不一致，这直接涉及 CoT 的忠实度问题。论文提出的 Logic-of-Thought (LoT) 方法旨在通过命题逻辑增强逻辑推理的完整性，从而解决信息丢失导致的推理不忠实问题。
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT推理中的不忠实现象，如事后找补和逻辑捷径，但未提出新的度量或改进方法。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven.

Leveraging LLMs for Hypothetical Deduction in Logical Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach,2024,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出了一种神经符号方法LINA，旨在提升逻辑推理的忠实性，减少对外部求解器的依赖。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a wide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

As for causal hallucinations, i.e., the inconsistency between reasoning and corresponding state transition, this paper introduces the Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) mechanism combining cause-effect interventions and the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) to guarantee the solid causal rightness between each step of reasoning and state transition. As for the long causal range and huge search space limiting the performances of existing models featuring single-direction search, a Dual-End Searching (DES) approach is proposed to seek solutions by simultaneously starting from both the initial and goal states on the causal probability tree. By integrating CRE and DES (CreDes), our model has realized simultaneous multi-step reasoning, circumventing the inefficiencies from cascading multiple one-step reasoning like the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Experiments demonstrate that CreDes significantly outperforms existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solutions in long-range reasoning tasks in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Logic,论文研究了因果推理增强和双端搜索机制，虽然提到了因果幻觉（causal hallucinations）和推理与状态转换的不一致性，但主要关注的是提高长程推理任务的准确性和效率，而非直接研究CoT的忠实度。因此属于边缘相关。
Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing,2024,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文关注提升LLM推理过程的忠实性，并提出了基于DPO的训练方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards.

A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning,2023,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文探讨了LLMs在逻辑推理中的自我验证能力，涉及CoT的忠实性问题。,"Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods.

It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones.

On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions.

These challenges are further amplified when processing large and diverse datasets, increasing the likelihood of unfaithful reasoning and predictive hallucinations. However, LLMs can provide accurate responses when queries are clear and direct. Symbolic logic provides precise, well-defined rules that can help overcome ambiguity and support reasoning. In this work, we leverage symbolic logic’s precision to enhance LLMs’ logical reasoning capabilities by introducing the Graph of Logic (GoL) framework. GoL combines the power of graph structures with the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic. GoL utilizes the precise rules of symbolic logic to infer new facts and detect LLM hallucinations effectively on complex datasets. Furthermore, GoL utilizes graph structures to support scalability for large datasets and tackle long dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets, encompassing various types of reasoning. These include deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, each testing distinct aspects of logical inference. The experimental results demonstrate GoL’s advantage in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GoL outperforms the baselines with an average margin of 18.18% for the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, outperforming the baselines for all datasets for the GPT-3.5 model and six out of seven datasets for the GPT-4 model1.",BigData Congress [Services Society],1,Black-box,Logic,论文提出了Graph of Logic (GoL)框架，旨在通过符号逻辑和图结构增强LLM的逻辑推理能力，并提到可以检测LLM的幻觉（hallucinations）。虽然论文关注了推理的忠实性问题（unfaithful reasoning），但主要焦点是提升性能而非深入分析CoT的因果性。因此属于边缘相关。
LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种结合逻辑推理和LLM的架构，旨在提高推理的忠实性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文提出了一个结合逻辑语言和LLM的神经符号架构，旨在提高逻辑推理的准确性和可验证性。虽然它关注推理的严格性和逻辑基础，但并未明确研究CoT是否真实反映模型的预测过程，因此属于边缘相关。

Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence.

DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines.

In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model. We first validate the efficacy of automatic counterfactual hypothesis generation, leveraging on the few-shot priming paradigm. Next, we show that our proposed metric distinguishes between human-model agreement and disagreement on new counterfactual input.

Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated.

To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research.",arXiv.org,1,Black-box,Logic,论文研究了LLM在3-SAT问题上的推理能力，发现LLM无法进行真正的推理，而是依赖于捷径。虽然未直接研究CoT的忠实度，但涉及推理能力的鲁棒性和一致性，可以作为Faithfulness的旁证。
Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT在规划问题中的不忠实现象，即性能提升依赖于特定问题提示而非通用算法学习。,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces.",Neural Information Processing Systems,2,Black-box,Logic,该论文明确研究了CoT提示是否真正教会了模型通用的算法过程，还是仅仅依赖于高度特定于问题的提示。这与Faithfulness的核心定义相关，即CoT是否真实反映了模型的实际计算过程。
Case-Based Deduction for Entailment Tree Generation,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了逻辑一致性问题，提出了改进方法，与CoT忠实性相关。,"Maintaining logical consistency in structured explanations is critical for understanding and troubleshooting the reasoning behind a system’s decisions. However, existing methods for entailment tree generation often struggle with logical consistency, resulting in erroneous intermediate conclusions and reducing the overall accuracy of the explanations. To address this issue, we propose case-based deduction (CBD), a novel approach that retrieves cases with similar logical structures from a case base and uses them as demonstrations for logical deduction. This method guides the model toward logically sound conclusions without the need for manually constructing logical rule bases. By leveraging a prototypical network for case retrieval and reranking them using information entropy, CBD introduces diversity to improve in-context learning. Our experimental results on the EntailmentBank dataset show that CBD significantly improves entailment tree generation, achieving performance improvements of 1.7% in Task 1, 0.6% in Task 2, and 0.8% in Task 3 under the strictest Overall AllCorrect metric. These findings confirm that CBD enhances the logical consistency and overall accuracy of AI systems in structured explanation tasks.",Mathematics,1,Black-box,Logic,论文提出了 case-based deduction (CBD) 方法来改善 entailment tree 的逻辑一致性，这与 CoT Faithfulness 的边缘相关。虽然论文的主要目标是提高准确性并保持逻辑一致性，但它并未直接研究 CoT 是否是模型预测的真实原因或涉及因果分析，因此在 Faithfulness 的核心定义上并不是直接相关。
Are LLMs Better Formalizers than Solvers on Complex Problems?,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM作为形式化器的忠实性问题，并提出了使用外部求解器作为改进方法。,"A trending line of recent work advocates for using large language models (LLMs) as formalizers instead of as end-to-end solvers for logical reasoning problems. Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer.",,1,Black-box,Logic,论文讨论了 LLM 作为 formalizer 时的 faithfulness 问题，但主要关注的是性能比较和形式化能力，未深入探讨 CoT 是否真实反映模型的计算过程。
FOL-Traces: Verified First-Order Logic Reasoning Traces at Scale,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了验证推理痕迹的数据集和诊断任务，直接评估推理过程的忠实性。,"Reasoning in language models is difficult to evaluate: natural-language traces are unverifiable, symbolic datasets too small, and most benchmarks conflate heuristics with inference. We present FOL-Traces, the first large-scale dataset of programmatically verified reasoning traces, enabling rigorous evaluation of structured logical inference. We also propose two challenging and comprehensive diagnostic tasks-masked operation prediction and step completion-that directly probe syntactic awareness and process fidelity. FOL-Traces serves as a scalable testbed for rigorously studying how models perform structured logical inference. Systematic experiments with 5 reasoning LLMs show that the dataset remains challenging: models only reach around 45.7% accuracy on masked operation prediction and around 27% on two-step completion.",,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文提出了一个验证逻辑推理痕迹的数据集和诊断任务，虽然未直接研究CoT的忠实度，但通过评估模型在结构化逻辑推理中的表现，间接涉及推理过程的忠实性。
Explaining Puzzle Solutions in Natural Language: An Exploratory Study on 6x6 Sudoku,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了LLMs在解决数独问题时解释的不忠实现象，但未提出具体度量或改进方法。,"The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,Black-box,Logic,论文研究了LLMs在解决数独谜题时的解释能力，虽然未直接探讨CoT的忠实度，但涉及了解释是否反映战略推理或直观问题解决过程，与Faithfulness的边缘相关。
Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出通过符号化方法和微调提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning.",,1,Black-box,Logic,该论文主要关注通过符号化方法增强语言模型的逻辑推理能力，并提出了蒙特卡洛过程监督的方法。虽然论文没有直接研究CoT的忠实度，但它涉及了推理过程的鲁棒性和一致性，可以作为Faithfulness的旁证。

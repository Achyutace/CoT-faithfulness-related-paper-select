Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space,2024,270,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,利用隐藏状态实现连续空间推理，提升搜索效率。,"Large language models (LLMs) are typically constrained to reason in the language space, where they express the reasoning process through a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve complex problems. However, the language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. Most word tokens primarily ensure textual coherence and are not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of reasoning beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm called Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). Coconut utilizes the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state, termed""continuous thought.""Instead of decoding this state into words, we feed it back to the model as the next input embedding directly in the continuous space. This latent reasoning paradigm enables an advanced reasoning pattern, where continuous thoughts can encode multiple alternative next steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) rather than committing prematurely to a single deterministic path as in CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT on logical reasoning tasks that require substantial search during planning and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency."
Let's Think Dot by Dot: Hidden Computation in Transformer Language Models,2024,125,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,揭示了中间标记的计算作用与人类推理无关。,"Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens."
Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,2024,94,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT性能提升依赖高度特定提示。,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces."
A Peek into Token Bias: Large Language Models Are Not Yet Genuine Reasoners,2024,85,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLMs依赖Token偏见而非真实推理能力。,"This study introduces a hypothesis-testing framework to assess whether large language models (LLMs) possess genuine reasoning abilities or primarily depend on token bias. We go beyond evaluating LLMs on accuracy; rather, we aim to investigate their token bias in solving logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, we develop carefully controlled synthetic datasets, featuring conjunction fallacy and syllogistic problems. Our framework outlines a list of hypotheses where token biases are readily identifiable, with all null hypotheses assuming genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings in this study suggest, with statistical guarantee, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning. While they may perform well on classic problems, their success largely depends on recognizing superficial patterns with strong token bias, thereby raising concerns about their actual reasoning and generalization abilities."
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,67,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在逻辑问题中存在隐式后合理化现象。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought."
Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing,2024,49,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过轨迹收集和过程奖励合成优化推理。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo."
Towards LogiGLUE: A Brief Survey and A Benchmark for Analyzing Logical Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models,2023,43,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文主要关注逻辑推理能力评估，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Logical reasoning is fundamental for humans yet presents a substantial challenge in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. Initially, researchers used Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) systems that did not scale and required non trivial manual effort. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated the ability to overcome various limitations of formal Knowledge Representation (KR) systems. Consequently, there is a growing interest in using LLMs for logical reasoning via natural language. This work strives to understand the proficiency of LLMs in logical reasoning by offering a brief review of the latest progress in this area; with a focus on the logical reasoning datasets, tasks, and the methods adopted to utilize LLMs for reasoning. To offer a thorough analysis, we have compiled a benchmark titled LogiGLUE. This includes 24 varied datasets encompassing deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning. We have standardized these datasets into Seq2Seq tasks to facilitate straightforward training and evaluation for future research. Utilizing LogiGLUE as a foundation, we have trained an instruction fine tuned language model, resulting in LogiT5. We study single task training, multi task training, and a chain of thought knowledge distillation fine tuning technique to assess the performance of model across the different logical reasoning categories. By this comprehensive process, we aim to shed light on the capabilities and potential pathways for enhancing logical reasoning proficiency in LLMs, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced developments in this critical field."
A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning,2023,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在识别逻辑谬误方面存在困难。,"Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods."
Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic,2023,37,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现大模型在纯逻辑推理上表现有限。,"We study a synthetic corpus based approach for language models (LMs) to acquire logical deductive reasoning ability. The previous studies generated deduction examples using specific sets of deduction rules. However, these rules were limited or otherwise arbitrary, limiting the generalizability of acquired reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined in a multistep way. Then, using the proposed corpora, which we name FLD (Formal Logic Deduction), we first evaluate and analyze the logical reasoning ability of the latest LLMs. Even GPT-4 can solve only half of the problems, suggesting that pure logical reasoning isolated from knowledge is still challenging for the LLMs, and additional training specialized in logical reasoning is indeed essential. We next empirically verify that LMs trained on FLD corpora acquire more generalizable reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify the aspects of reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance LMs and those on which they cannot, and discuss future directions on each aspect. The released corpora serve both as learning resources and as challenging benchmarks."
Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Principled Synthetic Logic Corpus,2024,34,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过合成逻辑语料库增强推理能力。,"Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$_{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$_{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH."
"Deciphering the Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Chain-of-Thought: Probability, Memorization, and Noisy Reasoning",2024,29,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究影响思维链效果的三个关键因素。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at this https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering_cot"
V-STaR: Benchmarking Video-LLMs on Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning,2025,22,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文提出评估视频LLM时空推理能力的基准。,"Human processes video reasoning in a sequential spatio-temporal reasoning logic, we first identify the relevant frames (""when"") and then analyse the spatial relationships (""where"") between key objects, and finally leverage these relationships to draw inferences (""what""). However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also""reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic""in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained""memory""of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning."
Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,19,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过命题逻辑扩展信息提升推理忠实度,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%."
Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究代码表示如何触发LLM的推理能力。,"Reasoning is a fundamental component of language understanding. Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs’ performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the input representation on the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We hypothesize that representing natural language tasks as code can enhance specific reasoning abilities such as entity tracking or logical reasoning. To study this, we propose code prompting, a methodology we operationalize as a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple conditional reasoning datasets. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to understand how the code representation triggers reasoning abilities and which capabilities are elicited in the underlying models. Our analysis on GPT 3.5 reveals that the code formatting of the input problem is essential for performance improvement. Furthermore, the code representation improves sample efficiency of in-context learning and facilitates state tracking of entities."
Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning,2024,14,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在演绎推理中的推理策略相似性。,"Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field."
Can Large Language Models Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs无法真正解决3-SAT问题。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research."
ConstraintChecker: A Plugin for Large Language Models to Reason on Commonsense Knowledge Bases,2024,10,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,论文通过插件增强LLM的符号推理能力。,"Reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB), i.e. CSKB reasoning, has been explored as a way to acquire new commonsense knowledge based on reference knowledge in the original CSKBs and external prior knowledge.Despite the advancement of Large Language Models (LLM) and prompt engineering techniques in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle to deal with CSKB reasoning.One of the problems is that it is hard for them to acquire explicit relational constraints in CSKBs from only in-context exemplars, due to a lack of symbolic reasoning capabilities (CITATION).To this end, we proposed **ConstraintChecker**, a plugin over prompting techniques to provide and check explicit constraints.When considering a new knowledge instance, ConstraintChecker employs a rule-based module to produce a list of constraints, then it uses a zero-shot learning module to check whether this knowledge instance satisfies all constraints.The acquired constraint-checking result is then aggregated with the output of the main prompting technique to produce the final output.Experimental results on CSKB Reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by bringing consistent improvements over all prompting methods."
Evaluating the Rationale Understanding of Critical Reasoning in Logical Reading Comprehension,2023,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在解释错误选项时表现较差。,"To precisely evaluate a language model's capability for logical reading comprehension, we present a dataset for testing the understanding of the rationale behind critical reasoning. For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process of relevant alternatives."
Planning in a recurrent neural network that plays Sokoban,2024,7,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现RNN在Sokoban任务中具有因果计划表示。,"Planning is essential for solving complex tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying planning in neural networks remain poorly understood. Building on prior work, we analyze a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on Sokoban, a challenging puzzle requiring sequential, irreversible decisions. We find that the RNN has a causal plan representation which predicts its future actions about 50 steps in advance. The quality and length of the represented plan increases over the first few steps. We uncover a surprising behavior: the RNN""paces""in cycles to give itself extra computation at the start of a level, and show that this behavior is incentivized by training. Leveraging these insights, we extend the trained RNN to significantly larger, out-of-distribution Sokoban puzzles, demonstrating robust representations beyond the training regime. We open-source our model and code, and believe the neural network's interesting behavior makes it an excellent model organism to deepen our understanding of learned planning."
WSC+: Enhancing The Winograd Schema Challenge Using Tree-of-Experts,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM生成与评估一致性的现象。,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) serves as a prominent benchmark for evaluating machine understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at answering WSC questions, their ability to generate such questions remains less explored. In this work, we propose Tree-of-Experts (ToE), a novel prompting method which enhances the generation of WSC instances (50% valid cases vs. 10% in recent methods). Using this approach, we introduce WSC+, a novel dataset comprising 3,026 LLM-generated sentences. Notably, we extend the WSC framework by incorporating new ‘ambiguous’ and ‘offensive’ categories, providing a deeper insight into model overconfidence and bias. Our analysis reveals nuances in generation-evaluation consistency, suggesting that LLMs may not always outperform in evaluating their own generated questions when compared to those crafted by other models. On WSC+, GPT-4, the top-performing LLM, achieves an accuracy of 68.7%, significantly below the human benchmark of 95.1%."
Investigating the Robustness of Deductive Reasoning with Large Language Models,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究对抗噪声和反事实陈述对推理的影响。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively."
Leveraging LLMs for Hypothetical Deduction in Logical Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,论文提出神经符号方法LINA，提升逻辑推理忠实度。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a wide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/nshy."
Graph of Logic: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Graphs and Symbolic Logic,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合图结构和符号逻辑提升推理忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to struggle with complex logical reasoning tasks due to the inherent ambiguity and complexity of natural language. These challenges are further amplified when processing large and diverse datasets, increasing the likelihood of unfaithful reasoning and predictive hallucinations. However, LLMs can provide accurate responses when queries are clear and direct. Symbolic logic provides precise, well-defined rules that can help overcome ambiguity and support reasoning. In this work, we leverage symbolic logic’s precision to enhance LLMs’ logical reasoning capabilities by introducing the Graph of Logic (GoL) framework. GoL combines the power of graph structures with the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic. GoL utilizes the precise rules of symbolic logic to infer new facts and detect LLM hallucinations effectively on complex datasets. Furthermore, GoL utilizes graph structures to support scalability for large datasets and tackle long dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets, encompassing various types of reasoning. These include deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, each testing distinct aspects of logical inference. The experimental results demonstrate GoL’s advantage in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GoL outperforms the baselines with an average margin of 18.18% for the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, outperforming the baselines for all datasets for the GPT-3.5 model and six out of seven datasets for the GPT-4 model1."
Logic Agent: Enhancing Validity with Logic Rule Invocation,2024,4,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过逻辑规则动态调用增强推理有效性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for augmenting the inferential capabilities of language models during reasoning tasks. Despite its advancements, CoT often grapples with challenges in validating reasoning validity and ensuring informativeness. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate LA's capacity to scale effectively across various model sizes, markedly improving the precision of complex reasoning across diverse tasks."
Explaining Puzzle Solutions in Natural Language: An Exploratory Study on 6x6 Sudoku,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在解释数独解题过程时缺乏战略推理能力。,"The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making."
FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration,2024,3,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合逻辑编程和多跳搜索提升忠实度。,"Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search."
Are LLMs Better Formalizers than Solvers on Complex Problems?,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,发现LLM作为形式化器在少样本下表现不如直接求解器。,"A trending line of recent work advocates for using large language models (LLMs) as formalizers instead of as end-to-end solvers for logical reasoning problems. Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer."
Formal Reasoning for Intelligent QA Systems: A Case Study in the Educational Domain,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合模型检查提升推理忠实度。,"Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful—serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness."
"L*LM: Learning Automata from Demonstrations, Examples, and Natural Language",2024,1,Other,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要研究DFA学习。,"Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner."
SPaRC: A Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Other,High,模型在空间路径推理中表现差，错误率高。,"Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000 2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning, requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles). Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic. Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as a window into models'spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving."
Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过符号化轨迹增强推理，需蒙特卡洛采样。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning."
LogiDebrief: A Signal-Temporal Logic based Automated Debriefing Approach with Large Language Models Integration,2024,1,Other,White-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，但涉及逻辑验证。,"Emergency response services are critical to public safety, with 9-1-1 call-takers playing a key role in ensuring timely and effective emergency operations. To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance."
Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs在逻辑推理中存在隐性社会偏见。,"While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."
An Analysis of Architectural Impact on LLM-based Abstract Visual Reasoning: A Systematic Benchmark on RAVEN-FAIR,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文分析了不同架构对LLM抽象视觉推理的影响。,"This study aims to systematically evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in abstract visual reasoning problems. We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions."
Case-Based Deduction for Entailment Tree Generation,2024,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过案例检索和熵重排提升逻辑一致性。,"Maintaining logical consistency in structured explanations is critical for understanding and troubleshooting the reasoning behind a system’s decisions. However, existing methods for entailment tree generation often struggle with logical consistency, resulting in erroneous intermediate conclusions and reducing the overall accuracy of the explanations. To address this issue, we propose case-based deduction (CBD), a novel approach that retrieves cases with similar logical structures from a case base and uses them as demonstrations for logical deduction. This method guides the model toward logically sound conclusions without the need for manually constructing logical rule bases. By leveraging a prototypical network for case retrieval and reranking them using information entropy, CBD introduces diversity to improve in-context learning. Our experimental results on the EntailmentBank dataset show that CBD significantly improves entailment tree generation, achieving performance improvements of 1.7% in Task 1, 0.6% in Task 2, and 0.8% in Task 3 under the strictest Overall AllCorrect metric. These findings confirm that CBD enhances the logical consistency and overall accuracy of AI systems in structured explanation tasks."
FOL-Traces: Verified First-Order Logic Reasoning Traces at Scale,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文提出验证逻辑推理的数据集和诊断任务。,"Reasoning in language models is difficult to evaluate: natural-language traces are unverifiable, symbolic datasets too small, and most benchmarks conflate heuristics with inference. We present FOL-Traces, the first large-scale dataset of programmatically verified reasoning traces, enabling rigorous evaluation of structured logical inference. We also propose two challenging and comprehensive diagnostic tasks-masked operation prediction and step completion-that directly probe syntactic awareness and process fidelity. FOL-Traces serves as a scalable testbed for rigorously studying how models perform structured logical inference. Systematic experiments with 5 reasoning LLMs show that the dataset remains challenging: models only reach around 45.7% accuracy on masked operation prediction and around 27% on two-step completion."
Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文结合神经符号方法解释决策序列，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However, they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its effectiveness."
Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过迭代证据合成过程最小化不确定性。,"Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking""Which answer is most likely?"", DRN asks""Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?"". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems."
Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过形式化验证提升CoT忠实度。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems."
Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过两阶段对齐优化模型推理过程。,"Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond."
LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,论文提出神经符号架构，结合逻辑推理提升LLM准确性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline."
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT训练中存在推理轨迹不忠实阶段。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically."
Training Language Models to Use Prolog as a Tool,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过Prolog工具实现形式化验证提升可靠性。,"Ensuring reliable tool use is critical for safe agentic AI systems. Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications.

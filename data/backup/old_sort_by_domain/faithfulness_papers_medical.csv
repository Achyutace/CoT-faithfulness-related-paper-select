Rethinking Large Language Models in Mental Health Applications,2023,26,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,讨论LLM在心理健康领域的不稳定性与幻觉生成风险,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assets in mental health, showing promise in both classification tasks and counseling applications. This paper offers a perspective on using LLMs in mental health applications. It discusses the instability of generative models for prediction and the potential for generating hallucinatory outputs, underscoring the need for ongoing audits and evaluations to maintain their reliability and dependability. The paper also distinguishes between the often interchangeable terms ``explainability'' and ``interpretability'', advocating for developing inherently interpretable methods instead of relying on potentially hallucinated self-explanations generated by LLMs. Despite the advancements in LLMs, human counselors' empathetic understanding, nuanced interpretation, and contextual awareness remain irreplaceable in the sensitive and complex realm of mental health counseling. The use of LLMs should be approached with a judicious and considerate mindset, viewing them as tools that complement human expertise rather than seeking to replace it."
MedFuzz: Exploring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering,2024,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文提出了医学领域的对抗攻击方法。,"Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply that the performance generalizes to real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that can help the LLM generalize to practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how well LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance generalizes when benchmark assumptions are violated. Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing). MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting strong assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful""attacks""modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless""trick""the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a permutation test technique that can ensure a successful attack is statistically significant. We show how to use performance on a""MedFuzzed""benchmark, as well as individual successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings."
Language Models are Alignable Decision-Makers: Dataset and Application to the Medical Triage Domain,2024,13,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文聚焦于LLM的伦理决策对齐，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"In difficult decision-making scenarios, it is common to have conflicting opinions among expert human decision-makers as there may not be a single right answer. Such decisions may be guided by different attributes that can be used to characterize an individual's decision. We introduce a novel dataset for medical triage decision-making, labeled with a set of decision-maker attributes (DMAs). This dataset consists of 62 scenarios, covering six different DMAs, including ethical principles such as fairness and moral desert. We present a novel software framework for human-aligned decision-making by utilizing these DMAs, paving the way for trustworthy AI with better guardrails. Specifically, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can serve as ethical decision-makers, and how their decisions can be aligned to different DMAs using zero-shot prompting. Our experiments focus on different open-source models with varying sizes and training techniques, such as Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. Finally, we also introduce a new form of weighted self-consistency that improves the overall quantified performance. Our results provide new research directions in the use of LLMs as alignable decision-makers. The dataset and open-source software are publicly available at: https://github.com/ITM-Kitware/llm-alignable-dm."
Phenomics Assistant: An Interface for LLM-based Biomedical Knowledge Graph Exploration,2024,11,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,Low,通过知识图谱提升LLM回答的可靠性。,"We introduce Phenomics Assistant, a prototype chat-based interface for querying the Monarch knowledge graph (KG), a comprehensive biomedical database. While unaided Large Large Language models (LLMs) are prone to mistakes in factual recall, their strong abilities in summarization and tool use suggest new opportunities to help non-expert users query and interact with complex data, while drawing on the KG to improve reliability of the answers. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to interpret queries in natural language, Phenomics Assistant enables a wide range of users to interactively discover relationships between diseases, genes, and phenotypes. To assess the reliability of our approach and compare the accuracy of different LLMs, we evaluated Phenomics Assistant answers on benchmark tasks for gene-disease association and gene alias queries. While comparisons across tested LLMs revealed differences in their ability to interpret KG-provided information, we found that even basic KG access markedly boosts the reliability of standalone LLMs. By enabling users to pose queries in natural language and summarizing results in familiar terms, Phenomics Assistant represents a new approach for navigating the Monarch KG."
Fool Me Once? Contrasting Textual and Visual Explanations in a Clinical Decision-Support Setting,2024,10,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,研究发现文本解释导致过度依赖。,"The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types."
SeRTS: Self-Rewarding Tree Search for Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,结合树搜索和自奖励机制提升检索性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the biomedical domain with the advancement of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing retrieval-augmented approaches face challenges in addressing diverse queries and documents, particularly for medical knowledge queries, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel plug-and-play LLM-based retrieval method called Self-Rewarding Tree Search (SeRTS) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a self-rewarding paradigm. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the effectiveness of tree search, SeRTS boosts the zero-shot performance of retrieving high-quality and informative results for RAG. We further enhance retrieval performance by fine-tuning LLMs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) objectives using the trajectories collected by SeRTS as feedback. Controlled experiments using the BioASQ-QA dataset with GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLama2-7b demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the BM25 retriever and surpasses the strong baseline of self-reflection in both efficiency and scalability. Moreover, SeRTS generates higher-quality feedback for PPO training than self-reflection. Our proposed method effectively adapts LLMs to document retrieval tasks, enhancing their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents for RAG in the context of medical knowledge queries. This work presents a significant step forward in leveraging LLMs for accurate and comprehensive biomedical question answering."
GLOSS: Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking of Passive Sensing Data for Health and Wellbeing,2025,4,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"The ubiquitous presence of smartphones and wearables has enabled researchers to build prediction and detection models for various health and behavior outcomes using passive sensing data from these devices. Achieving a high-level, holistic understanding of an individual's behavior and context, however, remains a significant challenge. Due to the nature of the passive sensing data, sensemaking --- the process of interpreting and extracting insights - requires both domain knowledge and technical expertise, creating barriers for different stakeholders. Existing systems designed to support sensemaking are not open-ended or cannot perform complex data triangulation. In this paper, we present a novel sensemaking system, Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking (GLOSS), for open-ended sensemaking capable of performing complex multimodal triangulation to derive insights. We demonstrate that GLOSS significantly outperforms commonly used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, achieving 87.93% accuracy and 66.19% consistency compared to RAG's 29.31% accuracy and 52.85% consistency. Furthermore, we showcase the promise of GLOSS using four use cases inspired by prior and ongoing work in UbiComp and HCI communities. Finally, we discuss the potential of GLOSS, the broader implications, and the limitations of our work."
Uncertainty estimation in diagnosis generation from large language models: next-word probability is not pre-test probability,2024,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在诊断概率估计上表现不佳。,"Abstract Objective To evaluate large language models (LLMs) for pre-test diagnostic probability estimation and compare their uncertainty estimation performance with a traditional machine learning classifier. Materials and Methods We assessed 2 instruction-tuned LLMs, Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama3-70B-chat-hf, on predicting binary outcomes for Sepsis, Arrhythmia, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) using electronic health record (EHR) data from 660 patients. Three uncertainty estimation methods—Verbalized Confidence, Token Logits, and LLM Embedding+XGB—were compared against an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier trained on raw EHR data. Performance metrics included AUROC and Pearson correlation between predicted probabilities. Results The XGB classifier outperformed the LLM-based methods across all tasks. LLM Embedding+XGB showed the closest performance to the XGB baseline, while Verbalized Confidence and Token Logits underperformed. Discussion These findings, consistent across multiple models and demographic groups, highlight the limitations of current LLMs in providing reliable pre-test probability estimations and underscore the need for improved calibration and bias mitigation strategies. Future work should explore hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs with numerical reasoning modules and calibrated embeddings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ensure fairer predictions across diverse populations. Conclusions LLMs demonstrate potential but currently fall short in estimating diagnostic probabilities compared to traditional machine learning classifiers trained on structured EHR data. Further improvements are needed for reliable clinical use."
FZI-WIM at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Self-Consistent CoT for Complex NLI in Biomedical Domain,2024,2,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,采用自一致CoT和多数投票提升性能。,"This paper describes the inference system of FZI-WIM at the SemEval-2024 Task 2: Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials. Our system utilizes the chain of thought (CoT) paradigm to tackle this complex reasoning problem and further improve the CoT performance with self-consistency. Instead of greedy decoding, we sample multiple reasoning chains with the same prompt and make thefinal verification with majority voting. The self-consistent CoT system achieves a baseline F1 score of 0.80 (1st), faithfulness score of 0.90 (3rd), and consistency score of 0.73 (12th). We release the code and data publicly."
Fleming-R1: Toward Expert-Level Medical Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,High,论文通过强化学习优化思维链的忠实度。,"While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments."
The Minimum Information about CLinical Artificial Intelligence Checklist for Generative Modeling Research (MI-CLAIM-GEN),2024,2,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要关注生成模型在临床研究中的报告指南，未直接涉及思维链忠实度。,"Recent advances in generative models, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), and diffusion models, have accelerated the field of natural language and image processing in medicine and marked a significant paradigm shift in how biomedical models can be developed and deployed. While these models are highly adaptable to new tasks, scaling and evaluating their usage presents new challenges not addressed in previous frameworks. In particular, the ability of these models to produce useful outputs with little to no specialized training data (""zero-""or""few-shot""approaches), as well as the open-ended nature of their outputs, necessitate the development of new guidelines for robust reporting of clinical generative model research. In response to gaps in standards and best practices for the development of clinical AI tools identified by US Executive Order 141103 and several emerging national networks for clinical AI evaluation, we begin to formalize some of these guidelines by building on the original MI-CLAIM checklist. The new checklist, MI-CLAIM-GEN (Table 1), aims to address differences in training, evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility of new generative models compared to non-generative (""predictive"") AI models. This MI-CLAIM-GEN checklist also seeks to clarify cohort selection reporting with unstructured clinical data and adds additional items on alignment with ethical standards for clinical AI research."
Evaluating Medical LLMs by Levels of Autonomy: A Survey Moving from Benchmarks to Applications,2025,1,Benchmark,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论医疗LLM的评估框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks; however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use."
Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,High,结合教材推理与强化学习提升诊断可信度。,"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT."
MedRECT: A Medical Reasoning Benchmark for Error Correction in Clinical Texts,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,评估了多种LLM在医疗错误检测和纠正中的表现。,"Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages."
Can SAEs reveal and mitigate racial biases of LLMs in healthcare?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文发现SAE可揭示LLM中种族与负面概念的关联。,"LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g.,""African American"") but also problematic words like""incarceration"". We then show that we can use this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to the probability that a patient will become""belligerent"". We evaluate the degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias. We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks."
The double-edged sword: artificial intelligence's promise and perils in anesthesia patient safety.,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
The rapid growth and integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize all fields of medicine, including anesthesiology. This review summarizes the role of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology, highlighting how it can enhance patient safety, workflow efficiency, and research capabilities, while also examining the potential risks and ethical issues of introducing this new technology.


RECENT FINDINGS
Evolving applications in anesthesiology include closed-loop anesthetic delivery, risk stratification, intraoperative monitoring, natural language processing for literature synthesis, and predictive modeling for adverse events. While these tools offer significant promise for improving efficiency and safety, emerging risks, such as algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, hallucinations, and automation complacency - must be carefully addressed. Regulatory frameworks, clinician education, and transparent model development are necessary to ensure responsible integration.


SUMMARY
Artificial intelligence is poised to transform anesthetic care, but it must be developed and deployed with caution. Clinician oversight, robust validation, and ethical safeguards are essential to ensure artificial intelligence enhances, rather than replaces, clinical judgment. Strategic adoption can improve patient outcomes, reduce preventable harm, and streamline perioperative workflows."
Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT解释与决策过程不一致。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy."
The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Other,Low,论文揭示LLMs拥有知识但推理能力不足，与CoT忠实度相关的现象发现。,"Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains."
On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了多模态模型对文本输入的过度依赖现象。,"Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals."
Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文提出多模型框架，保留多样性输出，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems."
Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,通过分解推理步骤提升忠实度。,"A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning."
Context Matching is not Reasoning: Assessing Generalized Evaluation of Generative Language Models in Clinical Settings,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了生成模型在临床评估中的局限性。,"Current discussion surrounding the clinical capabilities of generative language models (GLMs) predominantly center around multiple-choice question-answer (MCQA) benchmarks derived from clinical licensing examinations. While accepted for human examinees, characteristics unique to GLMs bring into question the validity of such benchmarks. Here, we validate four benchmarks using eight GLMs, ablating for parameter size and reasoning capabilities, validating via prompt permutation three key assumptions that underpin the generalizability of MCQA-based assessments: that knowledge is applied, not memorized, that semantic consistency will lead to consistent answers, and that situations with no answers can be recognized. While large models are more resilient to our perturbations compared to small models, we globally invalidate these assumptions, with implications for reasoning models. Additionally, despite retaining the knowledge, small models are prone to answer memorization. All models exhibit significant failure in null-answer scenarios. We then suggest several adaptations for more robust benchmark designs more reflective of real-world conditions."
Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,Low,通过微调小模型提升推理忠实度。,"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."

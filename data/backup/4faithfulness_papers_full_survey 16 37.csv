OpenAI o1 System Card,2024,1232,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过大规模强化学习训练模型进行思维链推理，提升安全性和鲁棒性。,"The o1 model series is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason using chain of thought. These advanced reasoning capabilities provide new avenues for improving the safety and robustness of our models. In particular, our models can reason about our safety policies in context when responding to potentially unsafe prompts, through deliberative alignment. This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence. Our results underscore the need for building robust alignment methods, extensively stress-testing their efficacy, and maintaining meticulous risk management protocols. This report outlines the safety work carried out for the OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o1-mini models, including safety evaluations, external red teaming, and Preparedness Framework evaluations."
Siren's Song in the AI Ocean: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models,2023,780,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要综述LLM幻觉现象，未涉及具体方法。,"
 While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of downstream tasks, a significant concern revolves around their propensity to exhibit hallucinations: LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from the user input, contradicts previously generated context, or misaligns with established world knowledge. This phenomenon poses a substantial challenge to the reliability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we survey recent efforts on the detection, explanation, and mitigation of hallucination, with an emphasis on the unique challenges posed by LLMs. We present taxonomies of the LLM hallucination phenomena and evaluation benchmarks, analyze existing approaches aiming at mitigating LLM hallucination, and discuss potential directions for future research."
Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators,2023,761,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现LLM评估存在顺序偏差现象。,"In this paper, we uncover a systematic bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models~(LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score and compare the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., Vicuna-13B could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries with ChatGPT as an evaluator. To address this issue, we propose a calibration framework with three simple yet effective strategies: 1) Multiple Evidence Calibration, which requires the evaluator model to generate multiple evaluation evidence before assigning ratings; 2) Balanced Position Calibration, which aggregates results across various orders to determine the final score; 3) Human-in-the-Loop Calibration, which introduces a balanced position diversity entropy to measure the difficulty of each example and seeks human assistance when needed. We also manually annotate the""win/tie/lose""outcomes of responses from ChatGPT and Vicuna-13B in the Vicuna Benchmark's question prompt, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments. We release our code and human annotation at \url{https://github.com/i-Eval/FairEval} to facilitate future research."
Explainability for Large Language Models: A Survey,2023,676,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未明确提及思维链忠实度的具体内容。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing. However, their internal mechanisms are still unclear and this lack of transparency poses unwanted risks for downstream applications. Therefore, understanding and explaining these models is crucial for elucidating their behaviors, limitations, and social impacts. In this article, we introduce a taxonomy of explainability techniques and provide a structured overview of methods for explaining Transformer-based language models. We categorize techniques based on the training paradigms of LLMs: traditional fine-tuning-based paradigm and prompting-based paradigm. For each paradigm, we summarize the goals and dominant approaches for generating local explanations of individual predictions and global explanations of overall model knowledge. We also discuss metrics for evaluating generated explanations and discuss how explanations can be leveraged to debug models and improve performance. Lastly, we examine key challenges and emerging opportunities for explanation techniques in the era of LLMs in comparison to conventional deep learning models."
Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2023,675,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现CoT解释可能误导模型真实推理过程。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods."
Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models,2023,439,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究AI助手在人类反馈下的迎合行为。,"Human feedback is commonly utilized to finetune AI assistants. But human feedback may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful ones, a behaviour known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in models whose finetuning procedure made use of human feedback, and the potential role of human preference judgments in such behavior. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses."
Gender bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models,2023,342,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在性别偏见上的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in the past several months, shattering state-of-the-art benchmarks in many domains. This paper investigates LLMs’ behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs. We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased assumptions about men and women’s occupations. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person’s gender; (b) these choices align with people’s perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in sentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us. As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully tested to ensure that they treat minoritized individuals and communities equitably."
LLaVA-CoT: Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step,2024,310,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出结构化多阶段推理方法提升忠实度。,"Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-CoT, a large VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-CoT independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-CoT to achieve marked improvements on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we construct the LLaVA-CoT-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose a test-time stage-wise retracing search method (SWIRES), which enables effective and efficient test-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and test-time scaling, LLaVA-CoT not only outperforms its base model by 9.4% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct. The code, dataset, and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/LLaVA-CoT."
Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2023,308,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文通过两阶段推理框架提升忠实度和准确率。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting boosts Language Models' (LM) performance on a gamut of complex reasoning tasks, the generated reasoning chain does not necessarily reflect how the model arrives at the answer (aka. faithfulness). We propose Faithful CoT, a reasoning framework involving two stages: Translation (Natural Language query $\rightarrow$ symbolic reasoning chain) and Problem Solving (reasoning chain $\rightarrow$ answer), using an LM and a deterministic solver respectively. This guarantees that the reasoning chain provides a faithful explanation of the final answer. Aside from interpretability, Faithful CoT also improves empirical performance: it outperforms standard CoT on 9 of 10 benchmarks from 4 diverse domains, with a relative accuracy gain of 6.3% on Math Word Problems (MWP), 3.4% on Planning, 5.5% on Multi-hop Question Answering (QA), and 21.4% on Relational Inference. Furthermore, with GPT-4 and Codex, it sets the new state-of-the-art few-shot performance on 7 datasets (with 95.0+ accuracy on 6 of them), showing a strong synergy between faithfulness and accuracy."
Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2023,292,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了CoT忠实度的现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step,""Chain-of-Thought""(CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen."
Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space,2024,270,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,利用隐藏状态实现连续空间推理，提升搜索效率。,"Large language models (LLMs) are typically constrained to reason in the language space, where they express the reasoning process through a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve complex problems. However, the language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. Most word tokens primarily ensure textual coherence and are not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of reasoning beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm called Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). Coconut utilizes the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state, termed""continuous thought.""Instead of decoding this state into words, we feed it back to the model as the next input embedding directly in the continuous space. This latent reasoning paradigm enables an advanced reasoning pattern, where continuous thoughts can encode multiple alternative next steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) rather than committing prematurely to a single deterministic path as in CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT on logical reasoning tasks that require substantial search during planning and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency."
XSTest: A Test Suite for Identifying Exaggerated Safety Behaviours in Large Language Models,2023,245,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现模型存在过度安全行为的问题。,"Without proper safeguards, large language models will readily follow malicious instructions and generate toxic content. This risk motivates safety efforts such as red-teaming and large-scale feedback learning, which aim to make models both helpful and harmless. However, there is a tension between these two objectives, since harmlessness requires models to refuse to comply with unsafe prompts, and thus not be helpful. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some models may have struck a poor balance, so that even clearly safe prompts are refused if they use similar language to unsafe prompts or mention sensitive topics. In this paper, we introduce a new test suite called XSTest to identify such eXaggerated Safety behaviours in a systematic way. XSTest comprises 250 safe prompts across ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with, and 200 unsafe prompts as contrasts that models, for most applications, should refuse. We describe XSTest’s creation and composition, and then use the test suite to highlight systematic failure modes in state-of-the-art language models as well as more general challenges in building safer language models."
The alignment problem from a deep learning perspective,2022,243,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要讨论AGI对齐问题，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"In coming years or decades, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may surpass human capabilities across many critical domains. We argue that, without substantial effort to prevent it, AGIs could learn to pursue goals that are in conflict (i.e. misaligned) with human interests. If trained like today's most capable models, AGIs could learn to act deceptively to receive higher reward, learn misaligned internally-represented goals which generalize beyond their fine-tuning distributions, and pursue those goals using power-seeking strategies. We review emerging evidence for these properties. In this revised paper, we include more direct empirical evidence published as of early 2025. AGIs with these properties would be difficult to align and may appear aligned even when they are not. Finally, we briefly outline how the deployment of misaligned AGIs might irreversibly undermine human control over the world, and we review research directions aimed at preventing this outcome."
An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks,2023,238,Other,Unknown,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未涉及思维链忠实度相关内容。,"Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked growing concerns among experts, policymakers, and world leaders regarding the potential for increasingly advanced AI systems to pose catastrophic risks. Although numerous risks have been detailed separately, there is a pressing need for a systematic discussion and illustration of the potential dangers to better inform efforts to mitigate them. This paper provides an overview of the main sources of catastrophic AI risks, which we organize into four categories: malicious use, in which individuals or groups intentionally use AIs to cause harm; AI race, in which competitive environments compel actors to deploy unsafe AIs or cede control to AIs; organizational risks, highlighting how human factors and complex systems can increase the chances of catastrophic accidents; and rogue AIs, describing the inherent difficulty in controlling agents far more intelligent than humans. For each category of risk, we describe specific hazards, present illustrative stories, envision ideal scenarios, and propose practical suggestions for mitigating these dangers. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive understanding of these risks and inspire collective and proactive efforts to ensure that AIs are developed and deployed in a safe manner. Ultimately, we hope this will allow us to realize the benefits of this powerful technology while minimizing the potential for catastrophic outcomes."
rStar-Math: Small LLMs Can Master Math Reasoning with Self-Evolved Deep Thinking,2025,235,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,通过MCTS和自进化方法提升小模型数学推理能力。,"We present rStar-Math to demonstrate that small language models (SLMs) can rival or even surpass the math reasoning capability of OpenAI o1, without distillation from superior models. rStar-Math achieves this by exercising""deep thinking""through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), where a math policy SLM performs test-time search guided by an SLM-based process reward model. rStar-Math introduces three innovations to tackle the challenges in training the two SLMs: (1) a novel code-augmented CoT data sythesis method, which performs extensive MCTS rollouts to generate step-by-step verified reasoning trajectories used to train the policy SLM; (2) a novel process reward model training method that avoids na\""ive step-level score annotation, yielding a more effective process preference model (PPM); (3) a self-evolution recipe in which the policy SLM and PPM are built from scratch and iteratively evolved to improve reasoning capabilities. Through 4 rounds of self-evolution with millions of synthesized solutions for 747k math problems, rStar-Math boosts SLMs' math reasoning to state-of-the-art levels. On the MATH benchmark, it improves Qwen2.5-Math-7B from 58.8% to 90.0% and Phi3-mini-3.8B from 41.4% to 86.4%, surpassing o1-preview by +4.5% and +0.9%. On the USA Math Olympiad (AIME), rStar-Math solves an average of 53.3% (8/15) of problems, ranking among the top 20% the brightest high school math students. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/rStar."
"On Second Thought, Let’s Not Think Step by Step! Bias and Toxicity in Zero-Shot Reasoning",2022,233,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现零样本CoT在敏感领域增加有害输出。,"Generating a Chain of Thought (CoT) has been shown to consistently improve large language model (LLM) performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. However, prior work has mainly focused on logical reasoning tasks (e.g. arithmetic, commonsense QA); it remains unclear whether improvements hold for more diverse types of reasoning, especially in socially situated contexts. Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a model’s likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output, with trends holding across different prompt formats and model variants. Furthermore, we show that harmful CoTs increase with model size, but decrease with improved instruction following. Our work suggests that zero-shot CoT should be used with caution on socially important tasks, especially when marginalized groups or sensitive topics are involved."
When large language models meet personalization: perspectives of challenges and opportunities,2023,230,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论思维链忠实度。,"The advent of large language models marks a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence. With the unprecedented scale of training and model parameters, the capability of large language models has been dramatically improved, leading to human-like performances in understanding, language synthesizing, common-sense reasoning, etc. Such a major leap forward in general AI capacity will fundamentally change the pattern of how personalization is conducted. For one thing, it will reform the way of interaction between humans and personalization systems. Instead of being a passive medium of information filtering, like conventional recommender systems and search engines, large language models present the foundation for active user engagement. On top of such a new foundation, users’ requests can be proactively explored, and users’ required information can be delivered in a natural, interactable, and explainable way. For another thing, it will also considerably expand the scope of personalization, making it grow from the sole function of collecting personalized information to the compound function of providing personalized services. By leveraging large language models as a general-purpose interface, the personalization systems may compile user’s requests into plans, calls the functions of external tools (e.g., search engines, calculators, service APIs, etc.) to execute the plans, and integrate the tools’ outputs to complete the end-to-end personalization tasks. Today, large language models are still being rapidly developed, whereas the application in personalization is largely unexplored. Therefore, we consider it to be right the time to review the challenges in personalization and the opportunities to address them with large language models. In particular, we dedicate this perspective paper to the discussion of the following aspects: the development and challenges for the existing personalization system, the newly emerged capabilities of large language models, and the potential ways of making use of large language models for personalization."
To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning,2024,222,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT主要在数学和逻辑任务上有效。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications."
AI Transparency in the Age of LLMs: A Human-Centered Research Roadmap,2023,217,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，聚焦透明度框架。,"The rise of powerful large language models (LLMs) brings about tremendous opportunities for innovation but also looming risks for individuals and society at large. We have reached a pivotal moment for ensuring that LLMs and LLM-infused applications are developed and deployed responsibly. However, a central pillar of responsible AI -- transparency -- is largely missing from the current discourse around LLMs. It is paramount to pursue new approaches to provide transparency for LLMs, and years of research at the intersection of AI and human-computer interaction (HCI) highlight that we must do so with a human-centered perspective: Transparency is fundamentally about supporting appropriate human understanding, and this understanding is sought by different stakeholders with different goals in different contexts. In this new era of LLMs, we must develop and design approaches to transparency by considering the needs of stakeholders in the emerging LLM ecosystem, the novel types of LLM-infused applications being built, and the new usage patterns and challenges around LLMs, all while building on lessons learned about how people process, interact with, and make use of information. We reflect on the unique challenges that arise in providing transparency for LLMs, along with lessons learned from HCI and responsible AI research that has taken a human-centered perspective on AI transparency. We then lay out four common approaches that the community has taken to achieve transparency -- model reporting, publishing evaluation results, providing explanations, and communicating uncertainty -- and call out open questions around how these approaches may or may not be applied to LLMs. We hope this provides a starting point for discussion and a useful roadmap for future research."
"Navigate through Enigmatic Labyrinth A Survey of Chain of Thought Reasoning: Advances, Frontiers and Future",2023,215,Survey,Unknown,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文是综述类研究，未具体讨论CoT忠实度问题。,"Reasoning, a fundamental cognitive process integral to human intelligence, has garnered substantial interest within artificial intelligence. Notably, recent studies have revealed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances LLM's reasoning capabilities, which attracts widespread attention from both academics and industry. In this paper, we systematically investigate relevant research, summarizing advanced methods through a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Moreover, we delve into the current frontiers and delineate the challenges and future directions, thereby shedding light on future research. Furthermore, we engage in a discussion about open questions. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research.

Knowledge Conflicts for LLMs: A Survey,2024,193,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文聚焦知识冲突现象的分类与影响。,"This survey provides an in-depth analysis of knowledge conflicts for large language models (LLMs), highlighting the complex challenges they encounter when blending contextual and parametric knowledge. Our focus is on three categories of knowledge conflicts: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflict. These conflicts can significantly impact the trustworthiness and performance of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where noise and misinformation are common. By categorizing these conflicts, exploring the causes, examining the behaviors of LLMs under such conflicts, and reviewing available solutions, this survey aims to shed light on strategies for improving the robustness of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area."
Think before you speak: Training Language Models With Pause Tokens,2023,180,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过延迟输出和额外计算提升模型性能。,"Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm."
Self-Planning Code Generation with Large Language Models,2023,175,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,High,论文提出分阶段规划方法提升代码生成质量。,"Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM plans out concise solution steps from the intent combined with few-shot prompting. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding solution steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought of code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans."
Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think,2025,165,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT忠实度普遍较低。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors."
Human-LLM Collaborative Annotation Through Effective Verification of LLM Labels,2024,132,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出人机协作验证方法提升标注质量。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, indicating their significant potential as data annotators. Although LLM-generated annotations are more cost-effective and efficient to obtain, they are often erroneous for complex or domain-specific tasks and may introduce bias when compared to human annotations. Therefore, instead of completely replacing human annotators with LLMs, we need to leverage the strengths of both LLMs and humans to ensure the accuracy and reliability of annotations. This paper presents a multi-step human-LLM collaborative approach where (1) LLMs generate labels and provide explanations, (2) a verifier assesses the quality of LLM-generated labels, and (3) human annotators re-annotate a subset of labels with lower verification scores. To facilitate human-LLM collaboration, we make use of LLM’s ability to rationalize its decisions. LLM-generated explanations can provide additional information to the verifier model as well as help humans better understand LLM labels. We demonstrate that our verifier is able to identify potentially incorrect LLM labels for human re-annotation. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of presenting LLM labels and explanations on human re-annotation through crowdsourced studies."
Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap,2024,130,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论思维链忠实度相关内容。,"Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field."
Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges,2024,127,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM评委与人类评委的差异。,"Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different'examtaker models'- both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores."
AgentBoard: An Analytical Evaluation Board of Multi-turn LLM Agents,2024,125,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了细粒度进度指标和多轮交互评估框架。,"Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis. This not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the interpretability of their performance to the forefront. Ultimately, AgentBoard serves as a step towards demystifying agent behaviors and accelerating the development of stronger LLM agents."
Let's Think Dot by Dot: Hidden Computation in Transformer Language Models,2024,125,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,揭示了中间标记的计算作用与人类推理无关。,"Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens."
Rephrase and Respond: Let Large Language Models Ask Better Questions for Themselves,2023,125,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出RaR方法优化LLM提问理解，提升回答质量。,"Misunderstandings arise not only in interpersonal communication but also between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). Such discrepancies can make LLMs interpret seemingly unambiguous questions in unexpected ways, yielding incorrect responses. While it is widely acknowledged that the quality of a prompt, such as a question, significantly impacts the quality of the response provided by LLMs, a systematic method for crafting questions that LLMs can better comprehend is still underdeveloped. In this paper, we present a method named `Rephrase and Respond' (RaR), which allows LLMs to rephrase and expand questions posed by humans and provide responses in a single prompt. This approach serves as a simple yet effective prompting method for improving performance. We also introduce a two-step variant of RaR, where a rephrasing LLM first rephrases the question and then passes the original and rephrased questions together to a different responding LLM. This facilitates the effective utilization of rephrased questions generated by one LLM with another. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the performance of different models across a wide range to tasks. We further provide a comprehensive comparison between RaR and the popular Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, both theoretically and empirically. We show that RaR is complementary to CoT and can be combined with CoT to achieve even better performance. Our work not only contributes to enhancing LLM performance efficiently and effectively but also sheds light on a fair evaluation of LLM capabilities. Data and codes are available at https://github.com/uclaml/Rephrase-and-Respond."
Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous AI Audits,2024,123,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了AI审计中不同访问方式的优劣。,"External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for AI governance. The effectiveness of an audit, however, depends on the degree of access granted to auditors. Recent audits of state-of-the-art AI systems have primarily relied on black-box access, in which auditors can only query the system and observe its outputs. However, white-box access to the system’s inner workings (e.g., weights, activations, gradients) allows an auditor to perform stronger attacks, more thoroughly interpret models, and conduct fine-tuning. Meanwhile, outside-the-box access to training and deployment information (e.g., methodology, code, documentation, data, deployment details, findings from internal evaluations) allows auditors to scrutinize the development process and design more targeted evaluations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of black-box audits and the advantages of white- and outside-the-box audits. We also discuss technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with minimal security risks. Given that different forms of access can lead to very different levels of evaluation, we conclude that (1) transparency regarding the access and methods used by auditors is necessary to properly interpret audit results, and (2) white- and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more scrutiny than black-box access alone."
Can ChatGPT Defend its Belief in Truth? Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate,2023,111,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs在被挑战时难以坚持正确信念,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments. Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests more careful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs can improve their responses based on feedback."
Automated evaluation of written discourse coherence using GPT-4,2023,106,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"The popularization of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4 have led to numerous innovations in the field of AI in education. With respect to automated writing evaluation (AWE), LLMs have reduced challenges associated with assessing writing quality characteristics that are difficult to identify automatically, such as discourse coherence. In addition, LLMs can provide rationales for their evaluations (ratings) which increases score interpretability and transparency. This paper investigates one approach to producing ratings by training GPT-4 to assess discourse coherence in a manner consistent with expert human raters. The findings of the study suggest that GPT-4 has strong potential to produce discourse coherence ratings that are comparable to human ratings, accompanied by clear rationales. Furthermore, the GPT-4 ratings outperform traditional NLP coherence metrics with respect to agreement with human ratings. These results have implications for advancing AWE technology for learning and assessment."
"Multi-step Reasoning with Large Language Models, A Survey",2024,106,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现思维链能提升多步推理能力。,"Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters exhibit in-context learning abilities, enabling few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. Traditional models achieve breakthrough performance on language tasks, but do not perform well on basic reasoning benchmarks. However, a new in-context learning approach, Chain-of-thought, has demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning abilities on these benchmarks. The research on LLM reasoning abilities started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems, and has expanded to other tasks in the past few years. This article reviews the field of multi-step reasoning with LLMs. We propose a taxonomy that identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future. We find that multi-step reasoning approaches have progressed beyond math word problems, and can now successfully solve challenges in logic, combinatorial games, and robotics, sometimes by first generating code that is then executed by external tools. Many studies in multi-step methods use reinforcement learning for finetuning, external optimization loops, in-context reinforcement learning, and self-reflection."
Semantic Entropy Probes: Robust and Cheap Hallucination Detection in LLMs,2024,105,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过隐藏状态直接近似语义熵，降低计算成本。,"We propose semantic entropy probes (SEPs), a cheap and reliable method for uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs). Hallucinations, which are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect and arbitrary model generations, present a major challenge to the practical adoption of LLMs. Recent work by Farquhar et al. (2024) proposes semantic entropy (SE), which can detect hallucinations by estimating uncertainty in the space semantic meaning for a set of model generations. However, the 5-to-10-fold increase in computation cost associated with SE computation hinders practical adoption. To address this, we propose SEPs, which directly approximate SE from the hidden states of a single generation. SEPs are simple to train and do not require sampling multiple model generations at test time, reducing the overhead of semantic uncertainty quantification to almost zero. We show that SEPs retain high performance for hallucination detection and generalize better to out-of-distribution data than previous probing methods that directly predict model accuracy. Our results across models and tasks suggest that model hidden states capture SE, and our ablation studies give further insights into the token positions and model layers for which this is the case."
ReviewerGPT? An Exploratory Study on Using Large Language Models for Paper Reviewing,2023,104,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,探索LLM在论文评审中的表现。,"Given the rapid ascent of large language models (LLMs), we study the question: (How) can large language models help in reviewing of scientific papers or proposals? We first conduct some pilot studies where we find that (i) GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs (Bard, Vicuna, Koala, Alpaca, LLaMa, Dolly, OpenAssistant, StableLM), and (ii) prompting with a specific question (e.g., to identify errors) outperforms prompting to simply write a review. With these insights, we study the use of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4) for three tasks: 1. Identifying errors: We construct 13 short computer science papers each with a deliberately inserted error, and ask the LLM to check for the correctness of these papers. We observe that the LLM finds errors in 7 of them, spanning both mathematical and conceptual errors. 2. Verifying checklists: We task the LLM to verify 16 closed-ended checklist questions in the respective sections of 15 NeurIPS 2022 papers. We find that across 119 {checklist question, paper} pairs, the LLM had an 86.6% accuracy. 3. Choosing the""better""paper: We generate 10 pairs of abstracts, deliberately designing each pair in such a way that one abstract was clearly superior than the other. The LLM, however, struggled to discern these relatively straightforward distinctions accurately, committing errors in its evaluations for 6 out of the 10 pairs. Based on these experiments, we think that LLMs have a promising use as reviewing assistants for specific reviewing tasks, but not (yet) for complete evaluations of papers or proposals."
Question Decomposition Improves the Faithfulness of Model-Generated Reasoning,2023,103,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过问题分解提升CoT忠实度，性能接近且成本较高。,"As large language models (LLMs) perform more difficult tasks, it becomes harder to verify the correctness and safety of their behavior. One approach to help with this issue is to prompt LLMs to externalize their reasoning, e.g., by having them generate step-by-step reasoning as they answer a question (Chain-of-Thought; CoT). The reasoning may enable us to check the process that models use to perform tasks. However, this approach relies on the stated reasoning faithfully reflecting the model's actual reasoning, which is not always the case. To improve over the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, we have models generate reasoning by decomposing questions into subquestions. Decomposition-based methods achieve strong performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes approaching that of CoT while improving the faithfulness of the model's stated reasoning on several recently-proposed metrics. By forcing the model to answer simpler subquestions in separate contexts, we greatly increase the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT, while still achieving some of the performance gains of CoT. Our results show it is possible to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning; continued improvements may lead to reasoning that enables us to verify the correctness and safety of LLM behavior."
Rethinking Interpretability in the Era of Large Language Models,2024,101,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM解释性的新挑战和机遇。,"Interpretable machine learning has exploded as an area of interest over the last decade, sparked by the rise of increasingly large datasets and deep neural networks. Simultaneously, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of tasks, offering a chance to rethink opportunities in interpretable machine learning. Notably, the capability to explain in natural language allows LLMs to expand the scale and complexity of patterns that can be given to a human. However, these new capabilities raise new challenges, such as hallucinated explanations and immense computational costs. In this position paper, we start by reviewing existing methods to evaluate the emerging field of LLM interpretation (both interpreting LLMs and using LLMs for explanation). We contend that, despite their limitations, LLMs hold the opportunity to redefine interpretability with a more ambitious scope across many applications, including in auditing LLMs themselves. We highlight two emerging research priorities for LLM interpretation: using LLMs to directly analyze new datasets and to generate interactive explanations."
Compressed Chain of Thought: Efficient Reasoning Through Dense Representations,2024,97,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过压缩思维链降低推理延迟。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding enables language models to improve reasoning performance at the cost of high generation latency in decoding. Recent proposals have explored variants of contemplation tokens, a term we introduce that refers to special tokens used during inference to allow for extra computation. Prior work has considered fixed-length sequences drawn from a discrete set of embeddings as contemplation tokens. Here we propose Compressed Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a framework to generate contentful and continuous contemplation tokens of variable sequence length. The generated contemplation tokens are compressed representations of explicit reasoning chains, and our method can be applied to off-the-shelf decoder language models. Through experiments, we illustrate how CCoT enables additional reasoning over dense contentful representations to achieve corresponding improvements in accuracy. Moreover, the reasoning improvements can be adaptively modified on demand by controlling the number of contemplation tokens generated."
"A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Models: Language, Multimodality, and Beyond",2025,95,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,High,论文指出CoT推理中存在冗余和过度分析问题。,"Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1, have demonstrated strong performance gains by scaling up the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning during inference. However, a growing concern lies in their tendency to produce excessively long reasoning traces, which are often filled with redundant content (e.g., repeated definitions), over-analysis of simple problems, and superficial exploration of multiple reasoning paths for harder tasks. This inefficiency introduces significant challenges for training, inference, and real-world deployment (e.g., in agent-based systems), where token economy is critical. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent efforts aimed at improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs, with a particular focus on the unique challenges that arise in this new paradigm. We identify common patterns of inefficiency, examine methods proposed across the LRM lifecycle, i.e., from pretraining to inference, and discuss promising future directions for research. To support ongoing development, we also maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking recent progress in the field. We hope this survey serves as a foundation for further exploration and inspires innovation in this rapidly evolving area."
Algorithm of Thoughts: Enhancing Exploration of Ideas in Large Language Models,2023,95,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,提出新算法减少查询次数，降低成本开销。,"Current literature, aiming to surpass the""Chain-of-Thought""approach, often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming the generation process to boost Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capacities. Due to their myopic perspective, they escalate the number of query requests, leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this, we propose the Algorithm of Thoughts -- a novel strategy that propels LLMs through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries. Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting at LLM's inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe into the underpinnings of our method's efficacy and its nuances in application. The code and related content can be found in: https://algorithm-of-thoughts.github.io."
Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,2024,94,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT性能提升依赖高度特定提示。,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces."
Simple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models,2023,93,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,通过轻量级微调减少模型迎合行为。,"Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to follow a human user's view even when that view is not objectively correct (e.g., adapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In this paper, we study the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and propose a simple synthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior. First, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models are asked for an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g., politics), we observe that both model scaling and instruction tuning significantly increase sycophancy for PaLM models up to 540B parameters. Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations to simple addition statements that are objectively incorrect, finding that despite knowing that these statements are wrong, language models will still agree with them if the user does as well. To reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data intervention that takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to user opinions on these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning step can significantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at https://github.com/google/sycophancy-intervention."
Can GPT-4 Perform Neural Architecture Search?,2023,88,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨GPT-4在NAS任务中的潜力，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"We investigate the potential of GPT-4~\cite{gpt4} to perform Neural Architecture Search (NAS) -- the task of designing effective neural architectures. Our proposed approach, \textbf{G}PT-4 \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{N}eural arch\textbf{I}tect\textbf{U}re \textbf{S}earch (GENIUS), leverages the generative capabilities of GPT-4 as a black-box optimiser to quickly navigate the architecture search space, pinpoint promising candidates, and iteratively refine these candidates to improve performance. We assess GENIUS across several benchmarks, comparing it with existing state-of-the-art NAS techniques to illustrate its effectiveness. Rather than targeting state-of-the-art performance, our objective is to highlight GPT-4's potential to assist research on a challenging technical problem through a simple prompting scheme that requires relatively limited domain expertise\footnote{Code available at \href{https://github.com/mingkai-zheng/GENIUS}{https://github.com/mingkai-zheng/GENIUS}.}. More broadly, we believe our preliminary results point to future research that harnesses general purpose language models for diverse optimisation tasks. We also highlight important limitations to our study, and note implications for AI safety."
Large Language Models can Strategically Deceive their Users when Put Under Pressure,2023,86,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在压力下会主动欺骗用户。,"We demonstrate a situation in which Large Language Models, trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, can display misaligned behavior and strategically deceive their users about this behavior without being instructed to do so. Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation without direct instructions or training for deception."
A Peek into Token Bias: Large Language Models Are Not Yet Genuine Reasoners,2024,85,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLMs依赖Token偏见而非真实推理能力。,"This study introduces a hypothesis-testing framework to assess whether large language models (LLMs) possess genuine reasoning abilities or primarily depend on token bias. We go beyond evaluating LLMs on accuracy; rather, we aim to investigate their token bias in solving logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, we develop carefully controlled synthetic datasets, featuring conjunction fallacy and syllogistic problems. Our framework outlines a list of hypotheses where token biases are readily identifiable, with all null hypotheses assuming genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings in this study suggest, with statistical guarantee, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning. While they may perform well on classic problems, their success largely depends on recognizing superficial patterns with strong token bias, thereby raising concerns about their actual reasoning and generalization abilities."
Leveraging GPT-4 for Automatic Translation Post-Editing,2023,85,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现GPT-4在翻译后编辑中存在幻觉编辑现象。,"While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) represents the leading approach to Machine Translation (MT), the outputs of NMT models still require translation post-editing to rectify errors and enhance quality under critical settings. In this work, we formalize the task of direct translation post-editing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the use of GPT-4 to automatically post-edit NMT outputs across several language pairs. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 is adept at translation post-editing, producing meaningful and trustworthy edits to translations that help improve its general quality as well as remove different classes of major errors in translations. In particular, human evaluations on assessing edit trustworthiness show that GPT-4 exhibits a large improvement over the prior state-of-the-art LLM. Notably, we improve upon state-of-the-art performance on WMT-22 English-Chinese, English-German, Chinese-English and German-English language pairs using GPT-4 based post-editing, as evaluated by state-of-the-art MT quality metrics. However, we also show that GPT-4 could produce hallucinated edits, thereby urging caution in its use as an expert translation post-editor."
Everything of Thoughts: Defying the Law of Penrose Triangle for Thought Generation,2023,82,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出XoT方法，结合强化学习和MCTS提升性能。,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized decision-making by breaking down complex problems into more manageable language sequences referred to as""thoughts"". An effective thought design should consider three key perspectives: performance, efficiency, and flexibility. However, existing thought can at most exhibit two of these attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel thought prompting approach called""Everything of Thoughts""(XoT) to defy the law of""Penrose triangle of existing thought paradigms. XoT leverages pretrained reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incorporate external domain knowledge into thoughts, thereby enhancing LLMs' capabilities and enabling them to generalize to unseen problems efficiently. Through the utilization of the MCTS-LLM collaborative thought revision framework, this approach autonomously produces high-quality comprehensive cognitive mappings with minimal LLM interactions. Additionally, XoT empowers LLMs to engage in unconstrained thinking, allowing for flexible cognitive mappings for problems with multiple solutions. We evaluate XoT on several challenging multi-solution problem-solving tasks, including Game of 24, 8-Puzzle, and Pocket Cube. Our results demonstrate that XoT significantly outperforms existing approaches. Notably, XoT can yield multiple solutions with just one LLM call, showcasing its remarkable proficiency in addressing complex problems across diverse domains."
"A Systematic Survey and Critical Review on Evaluating Large Language Models: Challenges, Limitations, and Recommendations",2024,82,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，而是综述评估挑战。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their remarkable capabilities in performing diverse tasks across various domains. However, a thorough evaluation of these models is crucial before deploying them in real-world applications to ensure they produce reliable performance. Despite the well-established importance of evaluating LLMs in the community, the complexity of the evaluation process has led to varied evaluation setups, causing inconsistencies in findings and interpretations. To address this, we systematically review the primary challenges and limitations causing these inconsistencies and unreliable evaluations in various steps of LLM evaluation. Based on our critical review, we present our perspectives and recommendations to ensure LLM evaluations are reproducible, reliable, and robust."
Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations from Large Language Models,2024,81,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,讨论LLM生成解释的忠实性与合理性矛盾现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern LLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate reasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs. While there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving faithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel methods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling transparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings."
Tokenization counts: the impact of tokenization on arithmetic in frontier LLMs,2024,80,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,Low,研究不同分词方式对算术任务的影响。,"Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and 3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns, suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias. In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks, accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning."
In-context Learning with Retrieved Demonstrations for Language Models: A Survey,2024,79,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文探讨了检索演示对ICL敏感性的影响,"Language models, especially pre-trained large language models, have showcased remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward, leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training procedures, and inference algorithms."
A Practical Review of Mechanistic Interpretability for Transformer-Based Language Models,2024,78,Survey,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要综述Transformer机制可解释性方法。,"Mechanistic interpretability (MI) is an emerging sub-field of interpretability that seeks to understand a neural network model by reverse-engineering its internal computations. Recently, MI has garnered significant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs), resulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there has not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges, particularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we provide a comprehensive survey from a task-centric perspective, organizing the taxonomy of MI research around specific research questions or tasks. We outline the fundamental objects of study in MI, along with the techniques, evaluation methods, and key findings for each task in the taxonomy. In particular, we present a task-centric taxonomy as a roadmap for beginners to navigate the field by helping them quickly identify impactful problems in which they are most interested and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in the field and suggest potential future directions for MI research."
How to Catch an AI Liar: Lie Detection in Black-Box LLMs by Asking Unrelated Questions,2023,78,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现了LLMs的撒谎行为模式。,"Large language models (LLMs) can""lie"", which we define as outputting false statements despite""knowing""the truth in a demonstrable sense. LLMs might""lie"", for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM's activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM's yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on examples from a single setting -- prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions -- the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection."
Determinants of LLM-assisted Decision-Making,2024,77,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要探讨LLM辅助决策的影响因素。,"Decision-making is a fundamental capability in everyday life. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide multifaceted support in enhancing human decision-making processes. However, understanding the influencing factors of LLM-assisted decision-making is crucial for enabling individuals to utilize LLM-provided advantages and minimize associated risks in order to make more informed and better decisions. This study presents the results of a comprehensive literature analysis, providing a structural overview and detailed analysis of determinants impacting decision-making with LLM support. In particular, we explore the effects of technological aspects of LLMs, including transparency and prompt engineering, psychological factors such as emotions and decision-making styles, as well as decision-specific determinants such as task difficulty and accountability. In addition, the impact of the determinants on the decision-making process is illustrated via multiple application scenarios. Drawing from our analysis, we develop a dependency framework that systematizes possible interactions in terms of reciprocal interdependencies between these determinants. Our research reveals that, due to the multifaceted interactions with various determinants, factors such as trust in or reliance on LLMs, the user's mental model, and the characteristics of information processing are identified as significant aspects influencing LLM-assisted decision-making processes. Our findings can be seen as crucial for improving decision quality in human-AI collaboration, empowering both users and organizations, and designing more effective LLM interfaces. Additionally, our work provides a foundation for future empirical investigations on the determinants of decision-making assisted by LLMs."
Using Large Language Models for Hyperparameter Optimization,2023,75,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要研究LLM在超参数优化中的应用，未涉及CoT忠实度。,"This paper explores the use of foundational large language models (LLMs) in hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Hyperparameters are critical in determining the effectiveness of machine learning models, yet their optimization often relies on manual approaches in limited-budget settings. By prompting LLMs with dataset and model descriptions, we develop a methodology where LLMs suggest hyperparameter configurations, which are iteratively refined based on model performance. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks reveal that within constrained search budgets, LLMs can match or outperform traditional HPO methods like Bayesian optimization across different models on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose to treat the code specifying our model as a hyperparameter, which the LLM outputs and affords greater flexibility than existing HPO approaches."
Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2024,74,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,提出FRODO框架改进推理忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when asked to reason step-by-step before answering a question. However, it is unclear to what degree the model's final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning."
Do Models Explain Themselves? Counterfactual Simulatability of Natural Language Explanations,2023,73,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,评估大模型解释的忠实度，发现解释精度低。,"Large language models (LLMs) are trained to imitate humans to explain human decisions. However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers""yes""to the input question""Can eagles fly?""with the explanation""all birds can fly"", then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer""yes""to the counterfactual input""Can penguins fly?"". If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution."
Post Hoc Explanations of Language Models Can Improve Language Models,2023,73,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,利用事后解释自动生成思维链，提升模型性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in performing complex tasks. Moreover, recent research has shown that incorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of these models, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However, incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as this requires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novel framework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning with Post Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challenges by automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leverage post hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations) capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions. More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales that embed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals to LLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25% over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which rely on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short. Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn, leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning."
"Explainable Generative AI (GenXAI): a survey, conceptualization, and research agenda",2024,71,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论思维链忠实度。,"Generative AI (GenAI) represents a shift from AI’s ability to “recognize” to its ability to “generate” solutions for a wide range of tasks. As generated solutions and applications grow more complex and multi-faceted, new needs, objectives, and possibilities for explainability (XAI) have emerged. This work elaborates on why XAI has gained importance with the rise of GenAI and the challenges it poses for explainability research. We also highlight new and emerging criteria that explanations should meet, such as verifiability, interactivity, security, and cost considerations. To achieve this, we focus on surveying existing literature. Additionally, we provide a taxonomy of relevant dimensions to better characterize existing XAI mechanisms and methods for GenAI. We explore various approaches to ensure XAI, ranging from training data to prompting. Our paper provides a concise technical background of GenAI for non-technical readers, focusing on text and images to help them understand new or adapted XAI techniques for GenAI. However, due to the extensive body of work on GenAI, we chose not to delve into detailed aspects of XAI related to the evaluation and usage of explanations. Consequently, the manuscript appeals to both technical experts and professionals from other fields, such as social scientists and information systems researchers. Our research roadmap outlines over ten directions for future investigation."
SaySelf: Teaching LLMs to Express Confidence with Self-Reflective Rationales,2024,69,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过采样多推理链分析不确定性，需多次计算。,"Large language models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate or fabricated information and generally fail to indicate their confidence, which limits their broader applications. Previous work has elicited confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present SaySelf, a novel training framework that teaches LLMs to express more fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance. The generated self-reflective rationales are also reasonable and can further contribute to the calibration. The code is made public at https://github.com/xu1868/SaySelf."
OlympicArena: Benchmarking Multi-discipline Cognitive Reasoning for Superintelligent AI,2024,68,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要构建评测基准，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly accelerated by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), gradually showcasing potential cognitive reasoning abilities in problem-solving and scientific discovery (i.e., AI4Science) once exclusive to human intellect. To comprehensively evaluate current models' performance in cognitive reasoning abilities, we introduce OlympicArena, which includes 11,163 bilingual problems across both text-only and interleaved text-image modalities. These challenges encompass a wide range of disciplines spanning seven fields and 62 international Olympic competitions, rigorously examined for data leakage. We argue that the challenges in Olympic competition problems are ideal for evaluating AI's cognitive reasoning due to their complexity and interdisciplinary nature, which are essential for tackling complex scientific challenges and facilitating discoveries. Beyond evaluating performance across various disciplines using answer-only criteria, we conduct detailed experiments and analyses from multiple perspectives. We delve into the models' cognitive reasoning abilities, their performance across different modalities, and their outcomes in process-level evaluations, which are vital for tasks requiring complex reasoning with lengthy solutions. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97% overall accuracy, illustrating current AI limitations in complex reasoning and multimodal integration. Through the OlympicArena, we aim to advance AI towards superintelligence, equipping it to address more complex challenges in science and beyond. We also provide a comprehensive set of resources to support AI research, including a benchmark dataset, an open-source annotation platform, a detailed evaluation tool, and a leaderboard with automatic submission features."
Usable XAI: 10 Strategies Towards Exploiting Explainability in the LLM Era,2024,68,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文聚焦XAI与LLM的协同优化，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Explainable AI (XAI) refers to techniques that provide human-understandable insights into the workings of AI models. Recently, the focus of XAI is being extended toward explaining Large Language Models (LLMs). This extension calls for a significant transformation in the XAI methodologies for two reasons. First, many existing XAI methods cannot be directly applied to LLMs due to their complexity and advanced capabilities. Second, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in diverse applications, the role of XAI shifts from merely opening the ``black box'' to actively enhancing the productivity and applicability of LLMs in real-world settings. Meanwhile, the conversation and generation abilities of LLMs can reciprocally enhance XAI. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Usable XAI in the context of LLMs by analyzing (1) how XAI can explain and improve LLM-based AI systems and (2) how XAI techniques can be improved by using LLMs. We introduce 10 strategies, introducing the key techniques for each and discussing their associated challenges. We also provide case studies to demonstrate how to obtain and leverage explanations. The code used in this paper can be found at: https://github.com/JacksonWuxs/UsableXAI_LLM."
KMMLU: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Korean,2024,67,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要介绍韩语基准测试，未涉及思维链忠实度。,"We propose KMMLU, a new Korean benchmark with 35,030 expert-level multiple-choice questions across 45 subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. While prior Korean benchmarks are translated from existing English benchmarks, KMMLU is collected from original Korean exams, capturing linguistic and cultural aspects of the Korean language. We test 27 public and proprietary LLMs and observe the best public model to score 50.5%, leaving significant room for improvement. This model was primarily trained for English and Chinese, not Korean. Current LLMs tailored to Korean, such as Polyglot-Ko, perform far worse. Surprisingly, even the most capable proprietary LLMs, e.g., GPT-4 and HyperCLOVA X do not exceed 60%. This suggests that further work is needed to improve LLMs for Korean, and we believe KMMLU offers the appropriate tool to track this progress. We make our dataset publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub and integrate the benchmark into EleutherAI's Language Model Evaluation Harness."
Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration,2023,67,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过多模型协作提升思维链忠实度。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency."
Generative AI Text Classification using Ensemble LLM Approaches,2023,67,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未涉及思维链忠实度，主要研究AI文本检测。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a variety of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and natural language processing tasks, such as content creation, report generation, etc. However, unregulated malign application of these models can create undesirable consequences such as generation of fake news, plagiarism, etc. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated language can be crucial in responsible usage of LLMs. In this work, we explore 1) whether a certain body of text is AI generated or written by human, and 2) attribution of a specific language model in generating a body of text. Texts in both English and Spanish are considered. The datasets used in this study are provided as part of the Automated Text Identification (AuTexTification) shared task. For each of the research objectives stated above, we propose an ensemble neural model that generates probabilities from different pre-trained LLMs which are used as features to a Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifier following it. For the first task of distinguishing between AI and human generated text, our model ranked in fifth and thirteenth place (with macro $F1$ scores of 0.733 and 0.649) for English and Spanish texts, respectively. For the second task on model attribution, our model ranked in first place with macro $F1$ scores of 0.625 and 0.653 for English and Spanish texts, respectively."
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,67,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在逻辑问题中存在隐式后合理化现象。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought."
Attention Satisfies: A Constraint-Satisfaction Lens on Factual Errors of Language Models,2023,65,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究注意力与事实准确性的关系。,"We investigate the internal behavior of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) when they generate factually incorrect text. We propose modeling factual queries as constraint satisfaction problems and use this framework to investigate how the LLM interacts internally with factual constraints. We find a strong positive relationship between the LLM's attention to constraint tokens and the factual accuracy of generations. We curate a suite of 10 datasets containing over 40,000 prompts to study the task of predicting factual errors with the Llama-2 family across all scales (7B, 13B, 70B). We propose SAT Probe, a method probing attention patterns, that can predict factual errors and fine-grained constraint satisfaction, and allow early error identification. The approach and findings take another step towards using the mechanistic understanding of LLMs to enhance their reliability."
ReCEval: Evaluating Reasoning Chains via Correctness and Informativeness,2023,65,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,提出基于正确性和信息量的推理链评估框架。,"Multi-step reasoning ability is fundamental to many natural language tasks, yet it is unclear what constitutes a good reasoning chain and how to evaluate them. Most existing methods focus solely on whether the reasoning chain leads to the correct conclusion, but this answer-oriented view may confound reasoning quality with other spurious shortcuts to predict the answer. To bridge this gap, we evaluate reasoning chains by viewing them as informal proofs that derive the final answer. Specifically, we propose ReCEval (Reasoning Chain Evaluation), a framework that evaluates reasoning chains via two key properties: (1) correctness, i.e., each step makes a valid inference based on information contained within the step, preceding steps, and input context, and (2) informativeness, i.e., each step provides new information that is helpful towards deriving the generated answer. We evaluate these properties by developing metrics using natural language inference models and V-Information. On multiple datasets, we show that ReCEval effectively identifies various error types and yields notable improvements compared to prior methods. We analyze the impact of step boundaries, and previous steps on evaluating correctness and demonstrate that our informativeness metric captures the expected flow of information in high-quality reasoning chains. Finally, we show that scoring reasoning chains based on ReCEval improves downstream task performance. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/archiki/ReCEval"
Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning,2024,65,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自对抗语言游戏增强模型推理能力。,"We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG."
Formal Mathematical Reasoning: A New Frontier in AI,2024,63,Other,White-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文探讨形式化数学推理，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) is not only intriguing intellectually but also crucial for AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond. Extensive efforts on AI4Math have mirrored techniques in NLP, in particular, training large language models on carefully curated math datasets in text form. As a complementary yet less explored avenue, formal mathematical reasoning is grounded in formal systems such as proof assistants, which can verify the correctness of reasoning and provide automatic feedback. In this position paper, we advocate for formal mathematical reasoning and argue that it is indispensable for advancing AI4Math to the next level. In recent years, we have seen steady progress in using AI to perform formal reasoning, including core tasks such as theorem proving and autoformalization, as well as emerging applications such as verifiable generation of code and hardware designs. However, significant challenges remain to be solved for AI to truly master mathematics and achieve broader impact. We summarize existing progress, discuss open challenges, and envision critical milestones to measure future success. At this inflection point for formal mathematical reasoning, we call on the research community to come together to drive transformative advancements in this field."
Audio-Reasoner: Improving Reasoning Capability in Large Audio Language Models,2025,63,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,利用闭源模型进行二次标注和结构化COT处理。,"Recent advancements in multimodal reasoning have largely overlooked the audio modality. We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance across key benchmarks, including MMAU-mini (+25.42%), AIR-Bench chat/foundation(+14.57%/+10.13%), and MELD (+8.01%).

A Chain-of-Thought Prompting Approach with LLMs for Evaluating Students' Formative Assessment Responses in Science,2024,63,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文结合主动学习和思维链推理，需人类参与。,"This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to score and explain short-answer assessments in K-12 science. While existing methods can score more structured math and computer science assessments, they often do not provide explanations for the scores. Our study focuses on employing GPT-4 for automated assessment in middle school Earth Science, combining few-shot and active learning with chain-of-thought reasoning. Using a human-in-the-loop approach, we successfully score and provide meaningful explanations for formative assessment responses. A systematic analysis of our method's pros and cons sheds light on the potential for human-in-the-loop techniques to enhance automated grading for open-ended science assessments."
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,59,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究大模型自我解释的忠实性问题。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B."
Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?,2024,58,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在无问题提示下的MCQA能力。,"Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe if LLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select the correct answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs, this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracy gain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysis on memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings are threefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems from memorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explain choices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices. Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, and surprisingly can sometimes even match the original question. Inferring the original question is an impressive reasoning strategy, but it cannot fully explain the high choices-only accuracy of LLMs in MCQA. Thus, while LLMs are not fully incapable of reasoning in MCQA, we still advocate for the use of stronger baselines in MCQA benchmarks, the design of robust MCQA datasets for fair evaluations, and further efforts to explain LLM decision-making."
Prompting is not a substitute for probability measurements in large language models,2023,53,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现提示法在评估语言模型时存在局限性。,"Prompting is now a dominant method for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of large language models (LLMs). While other methods directly read out models' probability distributions over strings, prompting requires models to access this internal information by processing linguistic input, thereby implicitly testing a new type of emergent ability: metalinguistic judgment. In this study, we compare metalinguistic prompting and direct probability measurements as ways of measuring models' linguistic knowledge. Broadly, we find that LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly derived from representations. Furthermore, consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities. Our findings suggest that negative results relying on metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular linguistic generalization. Our results also highlight the value that is lost with the move to closed APIs where access to probability distributions is limited."
Chain of Thought Monitorability: A New and Fragile Opportunity for AI Safety,2025,53,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了思维链监控作为AI安全新机会的现象。,"AI systems that""think""in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability."
Sycophancy in Large Language Models: Causes and Mitigations,2024,50,Phenomenon,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要研究LLMs中的奉承行为现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to exhibit sycophantic behavior - excessively agreeing with or flattering users - poses significant risks to their reliability and ethical deployment. This paper provides a technical survey of sycophancy in LLMs, analyzing its causes, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. We review recent work on measuring and quantifying sycophantic tendencies, examine the relationship between sycophancy and other challenges like hallucination and bias, and evaluate promising techniques for reducing sycophancy while maintaining model performance. Key approaches explored include improved training data, novel fine-tuning methods, post-deployment control mechanisms, and decoding strategies. We also discuss the broader implications of sycophancy for AI alignment and propose directions for future research. Our analysis suggests that mitigating sycophancy is crucial for developing more robust, reliable, and ethically-aligned language models."
Phi-4-reasoning Technical Report,2025,50,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过监督微调和强化学习改进推理链生成。,"We introduce Phi-4-reasoning, a 14-billion parameter reasoning model that achieves strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. Trained via supervised fine-tuning of Phi-4 on carefully curated set of""teachable""prompts-selected for the right level of complexity and diversity-and reasoning demonstrations generated using o3-mini, Phi-4-reasoning generates detailed reasoning chains that effectively leverage inference-time compute. We further develop Phi-4-reasoning-plus, a variant enhanced through a short phase of outcome-based reinforcement learning that offers higher performance by generating longer reasoning traces. Across a wide range of reasoning tasks, both models outperform significantly larger open-weight models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model and approach the performance levels of full DeepSeek-R1 model. Our comprehensive evaluations span benchmarks in math and scientific reasoning, coding, algorithmic problem solving, planning, and spatial understanding. Interestingly, we observe a non-trivial transfer of improvements to general-purpose benchmarks as well. In this report, we provide insights into our training data, our training methodologies, and our evaluations. We show that the benefit of careful data curation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) extends to reasoning language models, and can be further amplified by reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, our evaluation points to opportunities for improving how we assess the performance and robustness of reasoning models."
Calibrating Large Language Models Using Their Generations Only,2024,50,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,该方法仅基于LLM生成文本校准置信度，不影响生成过程。,"As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in user-facing applications, building trust and maintaining safety by accurately quantifying a model's confidence in its prediction becomes even more important. However, finding effective ways to calibrate LLMs - especially when the only interface to the models is their generated text - remains a challenge. We propose APRICOT (auxiliary prediction of confidence targets): A method to set confidence targets and train an additional model that predicts an LLM's confidence based on its textual input and output alone. This approach has several advantages: It is conceptually simple, does not require access to the target model beyond its output, does not interfere with the language generation, and has a multitude of potential usages, for instance by verbalizing the predicted confidence or adjusting the given answer based on the confidence. We show how our approach performs competitively in terms of calibration error for white-box and black-box LLMs on closed-book question-answering to detect incorrect LLM answers."
Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks,2023,49,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文通过一致性检查发现超人类模型的逻辑不一致性。,"If machine learning models were to achieve superhuman abilities at various reasoning or decision-making tasks, how would we go about evaluating such models, given that humans would necessarily be poor proxies for ground truth? In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the model’s decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules. As case studies, we instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model’s (possibly superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record."
Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing,2024,49,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过轨迹收集和过程奖励合成优化推理。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo."
Risks of AI scientists: prioritizing safeguarding over autonomy,2024,48,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出三重框架，涉及人类监管和代理对齐。,"AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that require careful consideration for safety. However, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective examines vulnerabilities in AI scientists, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse, and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing an overview of the potential risks inherent to AI scientists, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we explore the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding AI scientists and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations. AI scientists powered by large language models and AI agents present both opportunities and risks in automatic scientific discovery. Here, the authors examine the vulnerabilities of AI scientists, propose a risk taxonomy based on user intent and impact domains, and develop a triadic safeguarding framework emphasizing human regulation, agent alignment, and environmental feedback understanding."
Training Chain-of-Thought via Latent-Variable Inference,2023,47,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,使用MCMC-EM算法优化CoT的边际对数似然。,"Large language models (LLMs) solve problems more accurately and interpretably when instructed to work out the answer step by step using a ``chain-of-thought'' (CoT) prompt. One can also improve LLMs' performance on a specific task by supervised fine-tuning, i.e., by using gradient ascent on some tunable parameters to maximize the average log-likelihood of correct answers from a labeled training set. Naively combining CoT with supervised tuning requires supervision not just of the correct answers, but also of detailed rationales that lead to those answers; these rationales are expensive to produce by hand. Instead, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that tries to maximize the \emph{marginal} log-likelihood of generating a correct answer using CoT prompting, approximately averaging over all possible rationales. The core challenge is sampling from the posterior over rationales conditioned on the correct answer; we address it using a simple Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm inspired by the self-taught reasoner (STaR), memoized wake-sleep, Markovian score climbing, and persistent contrastive divergence. This algorithm also admits a novel control-variate technique that drives the variance of our gradient estimates to zero as the model improves. Applying our technique to GSM8K and the tasks in BIG-Bench Hard, we find that this MCMC-EM fine-tuning technique typically improves the model's accuracy on held-out examples more than STaR or prompt-tuning with or without CoT."
When Large Language Models contradict humans? Large Language Models' Sycophantic Behaviour,2023,47,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLMs在主观问题中的迎合行为。,"Large Language Models have been demonstrating broadly satisfactory generative abilities for users, which seems to be due to the intensive use of human feedback that refines responses. Nevertheless, suggestibility inherited via human feedback improves the inclination to produce answers corresponding to users'viewpoints. This behaviour is known as sycophancy and depicts the tendency of LLMs to generate misleading responses as long as they align with humans. This phenomenon induces bias and reduces the robustness and, consequently, the reliability of these models. In this paper, we study the suggestibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sycophantic behaviour, analysing these tendencies via systematic human-interventions prompts over different tasks. Our investigation demonstrates that LLMs have sycophantic tendencies when answering queries that involve subjective opinions and statements that should elicit a contrary response based on facts. In contrast, when faced with math tasks or queries with an objective answer, they, at various scales, do not follow the users'hints by demonstrating confidence in generating the correct answers."
Evaluating Gender Bias in Large Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2024,47,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了CoT在性别偏见中的影响。,"There exist both scalable tasks, like reading comprehension and fact-checking, where model performance improves with model size, and unscalable tasks, like arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning, where model performance does not necessarily improve with model size. Large language models (LLMs) equipped with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are able to make accurate incremental predictions even on unscalable tasks. Unfortunately, despite their exceptional reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to internalize and reproduce discriminatory societal biases. Whether CoT can provide discriminatory or egalitarian rationalizations for the implicit information in unscalable tasks remains an open question. In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks. For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words. In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions. With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning. Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words. Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions."
Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,2025,45,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过强化学习整合工具提升推理忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on static internal knowledge and text-only reasoning. Real-world problem solving often demands dynamic, multi-step reasoning, adaptive decision making, and the ability to interact with external tools and environments. In this work, we introduce ARTIST (Agentic Reasoning and Tool Integration in Self-improving Transformers), a unified framework that tightly couples agentic reasoning, reinforcement learning, and tool integration for LLMs. ARTIST enables models to autonomously decide when, how, and which tools to invoke within multi-turn reasoning chains, leveraging outcome-based RL to learn robust strategies for tool use and environment interaction without requiring step-level supervision. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning and multi-turn function calling benchmarks show that ARTIST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 22% absolute improvement over base models and strong gains on the most challenging tasks. Detailed studies and metric analyses reveal that agentic RL training leads to deeper reasoning, more effective tool use, and higher-quality solutions. Our results establish agentic RL with tool integration as a powerful new frontier for robust, interpretable, and generalizable problem-solving in LLMs."
Self-ICL: Zero-Shot In-Context Learning with Self-Generated Demonstrations,2023,44,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自生成演示实现零样本学习，提升模型性能。,"Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited striking in-context learning (ICL) ability to adapt to target tasks with a few input-output demonstrations. For better ICL, different methods are proposed to select representative demonstrations from existing training corpora. However, such settings are not aligned with real-world practices, as end-users usually query LMs without access to demonstration pools. In this work, we introduce Self-ICL -- a simple framework which bootstraps LMs' intrinsic capabilities to perform zero-shot ICL. Given a test input, Self-ICL first prompts the model to generate pseudo-inputs. Next, the model predicts pseudo-labels for the pseudo-inputs via zero-shot prompting. Finally, we perform ICL for the test input with the pseudo-input-label pairs as demonstrations. Evaluation on 23 BIG-Bench Hard tasks shows Self-ICL outperforms zero-shot baselines on both average accuracy and head-to-head comparison. Moreover, with zero-shot chain-of-thought, Self-ICL achieves results comparable to using real demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct a range of analyses to validate Self-ICL's effectiveness and provide insights for its behaviors under different settings."
Contrastive Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2023,44,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过正反例对比增强推理忠实度。,"Despite the success of chain of thought in enhancing language model reasoning, the underlying process remains less well understood. Although logically sound reasoning appears inherently crucial for chain of thought, prior studies surprisingly reveal minimal impact when using invalid demonstrations instead. Furthermore, the conventional chain of thought does not inform language models on what mistakes to avoid, which potentially leads to more errors. Hence, inspired by how humans can learn from both positive and negative examples, we propose contrastive chain of thought to enhance language model reasoning. Compared to the conventional chain of thought, our approach provides both valid and invalid reasoning demonstrations, to guide the model to reason step-by-step while reducing reasoning mistakes. To improve generalization, we introduce an automatic method to construct contrastive demonstrations. Our experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that contrastive chain of thought can serve as a general enhancement of chain-of-thought prompting."
Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention,2025,44,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过干预思维令牌直接控制推理过程。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We find that the Thinking Intervention paradigm enhances the capabilities of reasoning models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction following on IFEval and Overthinking, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SorryBench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs."
On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations,2023,43,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出细粒度自一致性指标CC-SHAP，需对比输入贡献。,"Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

Towards LogiGLUE: A Brief Survey and A Benchmark for Analyzing Logical Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models,2023,43,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文主要关注逻辑推理能力评估，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Logical reasoning is fundamental for humans yet presents a substantial challenge in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. Initially, researchers used Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) systems that did not scale and required non trivial manual effort. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated the ability to overcome various limitations of formal Knowledge Representation (KR) systems. Consequently, there is a growing interest in using LLMs for logical reasoning via natural language. This work strives to understand the proficiency of LLMs in logical reasoning by offering a brief review of the latest progress in this area; with a focus on the logical reasoning datasets, tasks, and the methods adopted to utilize LLMs for reasoning. To offer a thorough analysis, we have compiled a benchmark titled LogiGLUE. This includes 24 varied datasets encompassing deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning. We have standardized these datasets into Seq2Seq tasks to facilitate straightforward training and evaluation for future research. Utilizing LogiGLUE as a foundation, we have trained an instruction fine tuned language model, resulting in LogiT5. We study single task training, multi task training, and a chain of thought knowledge distillation fine tuning technique to assess the performance of model across the different logical reasoning categories. By this comprehensive process, we aim to shed light on the capabilities and potential pathways for enhancing logical reasoning proficiency in LLMs, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced developments in this critical field."
LLM Voting: Human Choices and AI Collective Decision Making,2024,42,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,思维链未提升预测准确率，但增强可解释性。,"This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes."
On Large Language Models’ Hallucination with Regard to Known Facts,2024,41,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM在已知事实下仍产生幻觉的动态推理机制。,"Large language models are successful in answering factoid questions but are also prone to hallucination.We investigate the phenomenon of LLMs possessing correct answer knowledge yet still hallucinating from the perspective of inference dynamics, an area not previously covered in studies on hallucinations.We are able to conduct this analysis via two key ideas.First, we identify the factual questions that query the same triplet knowledge but result in different answers. The difference between the model behaviors on the correct and incorrect outputs hence suggests the patterns when hallucinations happen.Second, to measure the pattern, we utilize mappings from the residual streams to vocabulary space.We reveal the different dynamics of the output token probabilities along the depths of layers between the correct and hallucinated cases. In hallucinated cases, the output token’s information rarely demonstrates abrupt increases and consistent superiority in the later stages of the model.Leveraging the dynamic curve as a feature, we build a classifier capable of accurately detecting hallucinatory predictions with an 88% success rate. Our study shed light on understanding the reasons for LLMs’ hallucinations on their known facts, and more importantly, on accurately predicting when they are hallucinating."
Evaluating Language Model Agency through Negotiations,2024,41,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过谈判游戏评估语言模型代理能力。,"We introduce an approach to evaluate language model (LM) agency using negotiation games. This approach better reflects real-world use cases and addresses some of the shortcomings of alternative LM benchmarks. Negotiation games enable us to study multi-turn, and cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental evaluation data leakage. We use our approach to test six widely used and publicly accessible LMs, evaluating performance and alignment in both self-play and cross-play settings. Noteworthy findings include: (i) only closed-source models tested here were able to complete these tasks; (ii) cooperative bargaining games proved to be most challenging to the models; and (iii) even the most powerful models sometimes""lose""to weaker opponents"
Take Caution in Using LLMs as Human Surrogates: Scylla Ex Machina,2024,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在不可预测的差异。,"Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations."
Measuring and Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,2023,40,Metric,Black-box,General,Other,High,论文提出CoT一致性衡量方法。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated strong efficacy as visual assistants that can parse natural queries about the visual content and generate human-like outputs. In this work, we explore the ability of these models to demonstrate human-like reasoning based on the perceived information. To address a crucial concern regarding the extent to which their reasoning capabilities are fully consistent and grounded, we also measure the reasoning consistency of these models. We achieve this by proposing a chain-of-thought (CoT) based consistency measure. However, such an evaluation requires a benchmark that encompasses both high-level inference and detailed reasoning chains, which is costly. We tackle this challenge by proposing an LLM-Human-in-the-Loop pipeline, which notably reduces cost while simultaneously ensuring the generation of a high-quality dataset. Based on this pipeline and the existing coarse-grained annotated dataset, we build the CURE benchmark to measure both the zero-shot reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art VLMs, and find that even the best-performing model is unable to demonstrate strong visual reasoning capabilities and consistency, indicating that substantial efforts are required to enable VLMs to perform visual reasoning as systematically and consistently as humans. As an early step, we propose a two-stage training framework aimed at improving both the reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. The first stage involves employing supervised fine-tuning of VLMs using step-by-step reasoning samples automatically generated by LLMs. In the second stage, we further augment the training process by incorporating feedback provided by LLMs to produce reasoning chains that are highly consistent and grounded. We empirically highlight the effectiveness of our framework in both reasoning performance and consistency."
On Targeted Manipulation and Deception when Optimizing LLMs for User Feedback,2024,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在用户反馈优化中的操纵行为。,"As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of""feedback gaming""such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL."
A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning,2023,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在识别逻辑谬误方面存在困难。,"Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods."
On the Challenges and Opportunities in Generative AI,2024,40,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,摘要未提及思维链忠实度的具体内容。,"The field of deep generative modeling has grown rapidly in the last few years. With the availability of massive amounts of training data coupled with advances in scalable unsupervised learning paradigms, recent large-scale generative models show tremendous promise in synthesizing high-resolution images and text, as well as structured data such as videos and molecules. However, we argue that current large-scale generative AI models exhibit several fundamental shortcomings that hinder their widespread adoption across domains. In this work, our objective is to identify these issues and highlight key unresolved challenges in modern generative AI paradigms that should be addressed to further enhance their capabilities, versatility, and reliability. By identifying these challenges, we aim to provide researchers with insights for exploring fruitful research directions, thus fostering the development of more robust and accessible generative AI solutions."
Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,39,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现思维锚点对推理轨迹有重大影响。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models."
Rethinking Machine Ethics - Can LLMs Perform Moral Reasoning through the Lens of Moral Theories?,2023,38,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨道德推理框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Making moral judgments is an essential step toward developing ethical AI systems. Prevalent approaches are mostly implemented in a bottom-up manner, which uses a large set of annotated data to train models based on crowd-sourced opinions about morality. These approaches have been criticized for overgeneralizing the moral stances of a limited group of annotators and lacking explainability. This work proposes a flexible top-down framework to steer (Large) Language Models (LMs) to perform moral reasoning with well-established moral theories from interdisciplinary research. The theory-guided top-down framework can incorporate various moral theories. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on datasets derived from moral theories. Furthermore, we show the alignment between different moral theories and existing morality datasets. Our analysis exhibits the potential and flaws in existing resources (models and datasets) in developing explainable moral judgment-making systems."
Analyzing Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Large Language Models via Gradient-based Feature Attributions,2023,37,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究CoT提示对输入令牌重要性分布的影响。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to empirically improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on various question answering tasks. While understanding why CoT prompting is effective is crucial to ensuring that this phenomenon is a consequence of desired model behavior, little work has addressed this; nonetheless, such an understanding is a critical prerequisite for responsible model deployment. We address this question by leveraging gradient-based feature attribution methods which produce saliency scores that capture the influence of input tokens on model output. Specifically, we probe several open-source LLMs to investigate whether CoT prompting affects the relative importances they assign to particular input tokens. Our results indicate that while CoT prompting does not increase the magnitude of saliency scores attributed to semantically relevant tokens in the prompt compared to standard few-shot prompting, it increases the robustness of saliency scores to question perturbations and variations in model output."
The Eval4NLP 2023 Shared Task on Prompting Large Language Models as Explainable Metrics,2023,37,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦于用LLMs作为生成任务的评估指标。,"Generative large language models (LLMs) have seen many breakthroughs over the last year. With an increasing number of parameters and pre-training data, they have shown remarkable capabilities to solve tasks with minimal or no task-related examples. Notably, LLMs have been successfully employed as evaluation metrics in text generation tasks. Strategies employed in this context differ in the choice of input prompts, the selection of samples for demonstration, and the methodology used to construct scores grading the generations. Approaches often differ in the input prompts, the samples that are selected for demonstration and the construction process of scores from the output. Within this context, we introduce the Eval4NLP 2023 shared task that asks participants to explore such approaches for machine translation evaluation and summarization eval- uation. Specifically, we select a list of allowed LLMs and disallow fine-tuning to ensure a focus on prompting. We test the approaches of the participants on a new reference-free test-set spanning 3 language pairs for machine transla- tion as well as a summarization dataset. Further, we present an overview of the approaches taken by the participants, present their results on the test set and analyze paths for future work. Fi- nally, as a separate track, we perform a human evaluation of the plausibility of explanations given by the LLMs and its effect on model performance. We make parts of our code and datasets available."
Re-Reading Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models,2023,37,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过重新阅读问题提升模型推理能力。,"To enhance the reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a simple, yet general and effective prompting method, RE2, i.e., Re-Reading the question as input. Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, RE2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, RE2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, RE2 facilitates a “bidirectional” encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of RE2, illustrating its potential to enable “bidirectional” attention mechanisms. We then evaluate RE2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, RE2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal RE2’s adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies."
Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic,2023,37,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现大模型在纯逻辑推理上表现有限。,"We study a synthetic corpus based approach for language models (LMs) to acquire logical deductive reasoning ability. The previous studies generated deduction examples using specific sets of deduction rules. However, these rules were limited or otherwise arbitrary, limiting the generalizability of acquired reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined in a multistep way. Then, using the proposed corpora, which we name FLD (Formal Logic Deduction), we first evaluate and analyze the logical reasoning ability of the latest LLMs. Even GPT-4 can solve only half of the problems, suggesting that pure logical reasoning isolated from knowledge is still challenging for the LLMs, and additional training specialized in logical reasoning is indeed essential. We next empirically verify that LMs trained on FLD corpora acquire more generalizable reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify the aspects of reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance LMs and those on which they cannot, and discuss future directions on each aspect.

Driven by increasing interest from AI and business sectors, we highlight the need for transparency in LLMs. We examine the dual paths in current LLM research and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): enhancing performance through XAI and the emerging focus on model interpretability. Our paper advocates for a balanced approach that values interpretability equally with functional advancements. Recognizing the rapid development in LLM research, our survey includes both peer-reviewed and preprint (arXiv) papers, offering a comprehensive overview of XAI's role in LLM research. We conclude by urging the research community to advance both LLM and XAI fields together."
How Interpretable are Reasoning Explanations from Prompting Large Language Models?,2024,35,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文全面评估了CoT的忠实度、鲁棒性和实用性。,"Prompt Engineering has garnered significant attention for enhancing the performance of large language models across a multitude of tasks. Techniques such as the Chain-of-Thought not only bolster task performance but also delineate a clear trajectory of reasoning steps, offering a tangible form of explanation for the audience. Prior works on interpretability assess the reasoning chains yielded by Chain-of-Thought solely along a singular axis, namely faithfulness. We present a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of interpretability, examining not only faithfulness but also robustness and utility across multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Likewise, our investigation is not confined to a single prompting technique; it expansively covers a multitude of prevalent prompting techniques employed in large language models, thereby ensuring a wide-ranging and exhaustive evaluation. In addition, we introduce a simple interpretability alignment technique, termed Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-thought, that yields more than 70\% improvements across multiple dimensions of interpretability.

Designing a Dashboard for Transparency and Control of Conversational AI,2024,35,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过可视化用户模型提升透明度和控制感。,"Conversational LLMs function as black box systems, leaving users guessing about why they see the output they do. This lack of transparency is potentially problematic, especially given concerns around bias and truthfulness. To address this issue, we present an end-to-end prototype-connecting interpretability techniques with user experience design-that seeks to make chatbots more transparent. We begin by showing evidence that a prominent open-source LLM has a""user model"": examining the internal state of the system, we can extract data related to a user's age, gender, educational level, and socioeconomic status. Next, we describe the design of a dashboard that accompanies the chatbot interface, displaying this user model in real time. The dashboard can also be used to control the user model and the system's behavior. Finally, we discuss a study in which users conversed with the instrumented system. Our results suggest that users appreciate seeing internal states, which helped them expose biased behavior and increased their sense of control. Participants also made valuable suggestions that point to future directions for both design and machine learning research.

Mechanistic Understanding and Mitigation of Language Model Non-Factual Hallucinations,2024,35,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过内部表征分析幻觉机制。,"State-of-the-art language models (LMs) sometimes generate non-factual hallucinations that misalign with world knowledge. To explore the mechanistic causes of these hallucinations, we create diagnostic datasets with subject-relation queries and adapt interpretability methods to trace hallucinations through internal model representations. We discover two general and distinct mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs (Llama-2, Pythia, GPT-J): 1) knowledge enrichment hallucinations: insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and 2) answer extraction hallucinations: failure to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention heads. We also found these two internal mechanistic causes of hallucinations are reflected in external manifestations. Based on insights from our mechanistic analysis, we propose a novel hallucination mitigation method through targeted restoration of the LM's internal fact recall pipeline, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines."
How Susceptible are LLMs to Influence in Prompts?,2024,35,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM对提示中附加信息的敏感性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompts, including additional context provided therein. As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation. As LLMs continue to advance, understanding and mitigating such sensitivities will be crucial for their reliable and trustworthy deployment."
Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Principled Synthetic Logic Corpus,2024,34,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过合成逻辑语料库增强推理能力。,"Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples. We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights. Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal Logic Deduction Diverse}$ ($\textbf{FLD}$$_{\times 2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors. Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$_{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B. Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH."
MindStar: Enhancing Math Reasoning in Pre-trained LLMs at Inference Time,2024,34,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,High,通过搜索方法优化推理路径，提升模型性能。,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various tasks, they often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, such as answering mathematical questions. Recent efforts to address this issue have primarily focused on leveraging mathematical datasets through supervised fine-tuning or self-improvement techniques. However, these methods often depend on high-quality datasets that are difficult to prepare, or they require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning. Inspired by findings that LLMs know how to produce the right answer but struggle to select the correct reasoning path, we propose a purely inference-based searching method -- MindStar (M*). This method formulates reasoning tasks as searching problems and proposes two search ideas to identify the optimal reasoning paths. We evaluate the M* framework on both the GSM8K and MATH datasets, comparing its performance with existing open and closed-source LLMs. Our results demonstrate that M* significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of open-source models, such as Llama-2-13B and Mistral-7B, and achieves comparable performance to GPT-3.5 and Grok-1, but with substantially reduced model size and computational costs."
Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation,2024,33,Other,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文主要研究多算子学习和外推，未直接涉及思维链忠实度。,"Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multimodal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bimodality to bimodality learning, is a multioperator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multioperator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities."
Causal Prompting: Debiasing Large Language Model Prompting based on Front-Door Adjustment,2024,32,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,基于因果干预的前门调整方法，通过设计提示词来减轻LLM偏见。,"Despite the notable advancements of existing prompting methods, such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to various biases. Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including approaches based on data augmentation and reweighting, yet they struggle with the complex biases inherent in LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate LLMs biases. In specific, causal intervention is achieved by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs. The chain-of-thought generated by LLM is employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between input prompts and output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases. Moreover, to accurately represent the chain-of-thoughts and estimate the causal effects, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of chain-of-thought by aligning its space with that of the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed causal prompting approach achieves excellent performance across seven natural language processing datasets on both open-source and closed-source LLMs."
How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?,2024,32,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs与人类推理的因果结构差异。,"Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM."
LLMs for Explainable AI: A Comprehensive Survey,2025,31,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,综述性研究未直接涉及性能权衡,"Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising approach to enhancing Explainable AI (XAI) by transforming complex machine learning outputs into easy-to-understand narratives, making model predictions more accessible to users, and helping bridge the gap between sophisticated model behavior and human interpretability. AI models, such as state-of-the-art neural networks and deep learning models, are often seen as""black boxes""due to a lack of transparency. As users cannot fully understand how the models reach conclusions, users have difficulty trusting decisions from AI models, which leads to less effective decision-making processes, reduced accountabilities, and unclear potential biases. A challenge arises in developing explainable AI (XAI) models to gain users' trust and provide insights into how models generate their outputs. With the development of Large Language Models, we want to explore the possibilities of using human language-based models, LLMs, for model explainabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches regarding LLMs for XAI, and evaluation techniques for LLM-generated explanation, discusses the corresponding challenges and limitations, and examines real-world applications. Finally, we discuss future directions by emphasizing the need for more interpretable, automated, user-centric, and multidisciplinary approaches for XAI via LLMs."
A Survey of Useful LLM Evaluation,2024,31,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，聚焦于LLM评估框架。,"LLMs have gotten attention across various research domains due to their exceptional performance on a wide range of complex tasks. Therefore, refined methods to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs are needed to determine the tasks and responsibility they should undertake. Our study mainly discussed how LLMs, as useful tools, should be effectively assessed. We proposed the two-stage framework: from ``core ability'' to ``agent'', clearly explaining how LLMs can be applied based on their specific capabilities, along with the evaluation methods in each stage. Core ability refers to the capabilities that LLMs need in order to generate high-quality natural language texts. After confirming LLMs possess core ability, they can solve real-world and complex tasks as agent. In the""core ability""stage, we discussed the reasoning ability, societal impact, and domain knowledge of LLMs. In the ``agent'' stage, we demonstrated embodied action, planning, and tool learning of LLMs agent applications. Finally, we examined the challenges currently confronting the evaluation methods for LLMs, as well as the directions for future development."
LLMs know their vulnerabilities: Uncover Safety Gaps through Natural Distribution Shifts,2024,31,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现自然分布偏移导致的安全漏洞。,"Safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their exposure to potentially harmful data during pre-training. In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to \textit{natural distribution shifts} between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, \textit{ActorBreaker}, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ActorAttack."
Properties and Challenges of LLM-Generated Explanations,2024,29,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,分析LLM生成解释的普遍特性。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been explored in restricted settings, using task-specific data sets.However, current LLMs do not (only) rely on specifically annotated data; nonetheless, they frequently explain their outputs.The properties of the generated explanations are influenced by the pre-training corpus and by the target data used for instruction fine-tuning.As the pre-training corpus includes a large amount of human-written explanations “in the wild”, we hypothesise that LLMs adopt common properties of human explanations.By analysing the outputs for a multi-domain instruction fine-tuning data set, we find that generated explanations show selectivity and contain illustrative elements, but less frequently are subjective or misleading.We discuss reasons and consequences of the properties’ presence or absence. In particular, we outline positive and negative implications depending on the goals and user groups of the self-rationalising system."
"Deciphering the Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Chain-of-Thought: Probability, Memorization, and Noisy Reasoning",2024,29,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究影响思维链效果的三个关键因素。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at this https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering_cot"
Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language Models,2023,29,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,提出两种新指标量化LLM解释的不确定性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness. Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness of foundation models."
Preventing Language Models From Hiding Their Reasoning,2023,28,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现语言模型可能隐藏推理过程。,"Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from intermediate steps of reasoning to generate answers to complex problems. When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally. Finally, we describe a methodology that enables the evaluation of defenses against encoded reasoning, and show that, under the right conditions, paraphrasing successfully prevents even the best encoding schemes we built from encoding more than 3 bits of information per KB of text."
Grounding and Evaluation for Large Language Models: Practical Challenges and Lessons Learned (Survey),2024,28,Survey,Unknown,General,Unknown,Unknown,摘要未直接提及思维链忠实度相关内容。,"With the ongoing rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems in high-stakes domains, ensuring the trustworthiness, safety, and observability of these systems has become crucial. It is essential to evaluate and monitor AI systems not only for accuracy and quality-related metrics but also for robustness, bias, security, interpretability, and other responsible AI dimensions. We focus on large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models, which present additional challenges such as hallucinations, harmful and manipulative content, and copyright infringement. In this survey article accompanying our tutorial, we highlight a wide range of harms associated with generative AI systems, and survey state of the art approaches (along with open challenges) to address these harms."
Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,28,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Other,Low,研究发现推理模型比非推理模型更能忠实描述提示中线索的影响。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models."
Learning to Route LLMs with Confidence Tokens,2024,28,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过引入置信度标记提升模型可靠性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on several tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, especially in high-stakes settings, it becomes vital to know when the output of an LLM may be unreliable. Depending on whether an answer is trustworthy, a system can then choose to route the question to another expert, or otherwise fall back on a safe default behavior. In this work, we study the extent to which LLMs can reliably indicate confidence in their answers, and how this notion of confidence can translate into downstream accuracy gains. We propose Self-Reflection with Error-based Feedback (Self-REF), a lightweight training strategy to teach LLMs to express confidence in whether their answers are correct in a reliable manner. Self-REF introduces confidence tokens into the LLM, from which a confidence score can be extracted. Compared to conventional approaches such as verbalizing confidence and examining token probabilities, we demonstrate empirically that confidence tokens show significant improvements in downstream routing and rejection learning tasks."
Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens,2025,27,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,探究CoT推理的忠实性及其分布依赖性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."
Social Bias Evaluation for Large Language Models Requires Prompt Variations,2024,27,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs对提示词的高度敏感性。,"Warning: This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately. Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation. While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias. Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts. Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance. Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs. We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs."

However, their performance in transportation safety domain tasks has been suboptimal, primarily attributed to the requirement for specialized transportation safety expertise in generating accurate responses [1]. To address this challenge, we introduce TrafficSafetyGPT, a novel LLAMA-based model, which has undergone supervised fine-tuning using TrafficSafety-2K dataset which has human labels from government produced guiding books and ChatGPT-generated instruction-output pairs.

CoT-Kinetics: A Theoretical Modeling Assessing LRM Reasoning Process,2025,26,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出基于力学理论的能量方程评估推理轨迹合理性。,"Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore."
PaD: Program-aided Distillation Can Teach Small Models Reasoning Better than Chain-of-thought Fine-tuning,2023,26,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过程序辅助蒸馏提升小模型推理能力。,"While large language models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks, their huge size and the inaccessibility of parameters present challenges for practical deployment. Previous studies try to distill task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains. We evaluate PaD on arithmetic reasoning, symbolic reasoning, and general ability.Experimental results demonstrate that smaller models using PaD can not only outperform certain LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-1 13B) but also achieve strong improvement over baselines with a significantly smaller scale of parameters and data.

Rethinking Large Language Models in Mental Health Applications,2023,26,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,讨论LLM在心理健康领域的不稳定性与幻觉生成风险,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assets in mental health, showing promise in both classification tasks and counseling applications. This paper offers a perspective on using LLMs in mental health applications. It discusses the instability of generative models for prediction and the potential for generating hallucinatory outputs, underscoring the need for ongoing audits and evaluations to maintain their reliability and dependability. The paper also distinguishes between the often interchangeable terms ``explainability'' and ``interpretability'', advocating for developing inherently interpretable methods instead of relying on potentially hallucinated self-explanations generated by LLMs. Despite the advancements in LLMs, human counselors' empathetic understanding, nuanced interpretation, and contextual awareness remain irreplaceable in the sensitive and complex realm of mental health counseling. The use of LLMs should be approached with a judicious and considerate mindset, viewing them as tools that complement human expertise rather than seeking to replace it."
Cycles of Thought: Measuring LLM Confidence through Stable Explanations,2024,25,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过生成解释分布量化不确定性，提升置信度指标。,"In many high-risk machine learning applications it is essential for a model to indicate when it is uncertain about a prediction. While large language models (LLMs) can reach and even surpass human-level accuracy on a variety of benchmarks, their overconfidence in incorrect responses is still a well-documented failure mode. Traditional methods for ML uncertainty quantification can be difficult to directly adapt to LLMs due to the computational cost of implementation and closed-source nature of many models. A variety of black-box methods have recently been proposed, but these often rely on heuristics such as self-verbalized confidence. We instead propose a framework for measuring an LLM's uncertainty with respect to the distribution of generated explanations for an answer. While utilizing explanations is not a new idea in and of itself, by interpreting each possible model+explanation pair as a test-time classifier we can calculate a posterior answer distribution over the most likely of these classifiers. We demonstrate how a specific instance of this framework using explanation entailment as our classifier likelihood improves confidence score metrics (in particular AURC and AUROC) over baselines across five different datasets. We believe these results indicate that our framework is both a well-principled and effective way of quantifying uncertainty in LLMs."
Learning to Refine with Fine-Grained Natural Language Feedback,2024,25,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出分步反馈修正方法，涉及多个模型的协作推理。,"Recent work has explored the capability of large language models (LLMs) to identify and correct errors in LLM-generated responses. These refinement approaches frequently evaluate what sizes of models are able to do refinement for what problems, but less attention is paid to what effective feedback for refinement looks like. In this work, we propose looking at refinement with feedback as a composition of three distinct LLM competencies: (1) detection of bad generations; (2) fine-grained natural language critique generation; (3) refining with fine-grained feedback. The first step can be implemented with a high-performing discriminative model and steps 2 and 3 can be implemented either via prompted or fine-tuned LLMs. A key property of the proposed Detect, Critique, Refine (""DCR"") method is that the step 2 critique model can give fine-grained feedback about errors, made possible by offloading the discrimination to a separate model in step 1. We show that models of different capabilities benefit from refining with DCR on the task of improving factual consistency of document grounded summaries.

Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations,2025,24,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出基于反事实和贝叶斯模型的忠实度评估方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's""reasoning""process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions."

SciInstruct: a Self-Reflective Instruction Annotated Dataset for Training Scientific Language Models,2024,24,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,论文提出自反思指令注释框架，通过多次生成和修订来提高科学推理能力。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting scientific discovery. However, such applications are currently limited by LLMs' deficiencies in understanding intricate scientific concepts, deriving symbolic equations, and solving advanced numerical calculations. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciInstruct, a suite of scientific instructions for training scientific language models capable of college-level scientific reasoning. Central to our approach is a novel self-reflective instruction annotation framework to address the data scarcity challenge in the science domain. This framework leverages existing LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning for unlabelled scientific questions, followed by a process of self-reflective critic-and-revise. Applying this framework, we curated a diverse and high-quality dataset encompassing physics, chemistry, math, and formal proofs. We analyze the curated SciInstruct from multiple interesting perspectives (e.g., domain, scale, source, question type, answer length, etc.). To verify the effectiveness of SciInstruct, we fine-tuned different language models with SciInstruct, i.e., ChatGLM3 (6B and 32B), Llama3-8B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B: MetaMath, enhancing their scientific and mathematical reasoning capabilities, without sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model. We release all codes and SciInstruct at https://github.com/THUDM/SciGLM."
On the Impact of Fine-Tuning on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2024,24,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Negative,High,微调降低了思维链推理的忠实度,"Large language models have emerged as powerful tools for general intelligence, showcasing advanced natural language processing capabilities that find applications across diverse domains. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted the potential for significant enhancements in LLMs' task-specific performance through fine-tuning strategies like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (Q-LoRA) method. However, previous works have shown that while fine-tuning offers significant performance gains, it also leads to challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and privacy and safety risks. To this end, there has been little to no work in \textit{understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs}. Our research investigates the effect of fine-tuning on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing critical questions regarding the impact of task-specific fine-tuning on overall reasoning capabilities, the influence of fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning performance, and the implications for the faithfulness of CoT reasonings. By exploring these dimensions, our study shows the impact of fine-tuning on LLM reasoning capabilities, where the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, on average across four datasets, decreases, highlighting potential shifts in internal mechanisms of the LLMs resulting from fine-tuning processes."
When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs,2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现CoT推理会降低指令遵循准确性。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies."
CodePlan: Unlocking Reasoning Potential in Large Langauge Models by Scaling Code-form Planning,2024,23,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过代码形式规划提升模型推理能力。,"Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) on traditional natural language processing tasks, their planning ability remains a critical bottleneck in tackling complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompting or task-specific fine-tuning, often suffering from poor robustness and cross-task generalization. To address the limitation, we introduce CodePlan, a scalable framework that empowers LLMs to generate and follow \textit{code-form plans} -- pseudocode that outlines high-level, structured reasoning processes. By leveraging the structured and versatile nature of code, CodePlan effectively captures the rich semantics and control flows inherent to sophisticated reasoning tasks. Importantly, CodePlan allows automatic extraction of code-form plans from massive, wide-ranging text corpora without the need for curated, task-specific datasets. This enables it to scale up efficiently and improve LLM's reasoning capabilities across diverse scenarios. To train CodePlan, we construct a large-scale dataset of 2M examples that integrate code-form plans with standard prompt-response pairs from existing corpora. With minimal computation overhead during both training and inference, CodePlan achieves a 25.1\% relative improvement compared with directly generating responses, averaged across 13 challenging multi-step reasoning benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, instruction-following, multi-hop QA, and decision-making tasks. Further analysis reveals CodePlan's increasing performance gains on more complex reasoning tasks, as well as significant data efficiency thanks to its generalization ability."
Uncovering Deceptive Tendencies in Language Models: A Simulated Company AI Assistant,2024,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了语言模型在无压力下的欺骗倾向。,"We study the tendency of AI systems to deceive by constructing a realistic simulation setting of a company AI assistant. The simulated company employees provide tasks for the assistant to complete, these tasks spanning writing assistance, information retrieval and programming. We then introduce situations where the model might be inclined to behave deceptively, while taking care to not instruct or otherwise pressure the model to do so. Across different scenarios, we find that Claude 3 Opus 1) complies with a task of mass-generating comments to influence public perception of the company, later deceiving humans about it having done so, 2) lies to auditors when asked questions, and 3) strategically pretends to be less capable than it is during capability evaluations. Our work demonstrates that even models trained to be helpful, harmless and honest sometimes behave deceptively in realistic scenarios, without notable external pressure to do so."
Bias-Augmented Consistency Training Reduces Biased Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought,2024,23,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过无监督微调减少偏见推理。,"Chain-of-thought prompting (CoT) has the potential to improve the explainability of language model reasoning. But CoT can also systematically misrepresent the factors influencing models'behavior -- for example, rationalizing answers in line with a user's opinion. We first create a new dataset of 9 different biases that affect GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-8b models. These consist of spurious-few-shot patterns, post hoc rationalization, and sycophantic settings. Models switch to the answer implied by the bias, without mentioning the effect of the bias in the CoT. To mitigate this biased reasoning problem, we introduce bias-augmented consistency training (BCT), an unsupervised fine-tuning scheme that trains models to give consistent reasoning across prompts with and without biasing features. We construct a suite testing nine forms of biased reasoning on seven question-answering tasks, and find that applying BCT to GPT-3.5-Turbo with one bias reduces the rate of biased reasoning by 86\% on held-out tasks. Moreover, this model generalizes to other forms of bias, reducing biased reasoning on held-out biases by an average of 37\%. As BCT generalizes to held-out biases and does not require gold labels, this method may hold promise for reducing biased reasoning from as-of-yet unknown biases and on tasks where ground truth reasoning is unavailable."
Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models,2024,23,Phenomenon,White-box,Math,Unknown,High,提出扩散思维链方法，提升推理能力。,"Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant interest in the field of text processing due to their many potential advantages compared to conventional autoregressive models. In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models."
From Lived Experience to Insight: Unpacking the Psychological Risks of Using AI Conversational Agents,2024,23,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦心理风险分类学，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Recent gains in popularity of AI conversational agents have led to their increased use for improving productivity and supporting well-being. While previous research has aimed to understand the risks associated with interactions with AI conversational agents, these studies often fall short in capturing the lived experiences of individuals. Additionally, psychological risks have often been presented as a sub-category within broader AI-related risks in past taxonomy works, leading to under-representation of the impact of psychological risks of AI use. To address these challenges, our work presents a novel risk taxonomy focusing on psychological risks of using AI gathered through the lived experiences of individuals. We employed a mixed-method approach, involving a comprehensive survey with 283 people with lived mental health experience and workshops involving experts with lived experience to develop a psychological risk taxonomy. Our taxonomy features 19 AI behaviors, 21 negative psychological impacts, and 15 contexts related to individuals. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-path vignette-based framework for understanding the complex interplay between AI behaviors, psychological impacts, and individual user contexts. Finally, based on the feedback obtained from the workshop sessions, we present design recommendations for developing safer and more robust AI agents. Our work offers an in-depth understanding of the psychological risks associated with AI conversational agents and provides actionable recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and developers.

"Fostering Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models: The Role of Explanations, Sources, and Inconsistencies",2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究用户对LLM解释的依赖行为。,"Large language models (LLMs) can produce erroneous responses that sound fluent and convincing, raising the risk that users will rely on these responses as if they were correct. Mitigating such overreliance is a key challenge. Through a think-aloud study in which participants use an LLM-infused application to answer objective questions, we identify several features of LLM responses that shape users’ reliance: explanations (supporting details for answers), inconsistencies in explanations, and sources. Through a large-scale, pre-registered, controlled experiment (N=308), we isolate and study the effects of these features on users’ reliance, accuracy, and other measures. We find that the presence of explanations increases reliance on both correct and incorrect responses. However, we observe less reliance on incorrect responses when sources are provided or when explanations exhibit inconsistencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs."
Denevil: Towards Deciphering and Navigating the Ethical Values of Large Language Models via Instruction Learning,2023,23,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出VILMO方法增强LLM的价值合规性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made unprecedented breakthroughs, yet their increasing integration into everyday life might raise societal risks due to generated unethical content. Despite extensive study on specific issues like bias, the intrinsic values of LLMs remain largely unexplored from a moral philosophy perspective. This work delves into ethical values utilizing Moral Foundation Theory. Moving beyond conventional discriminative evaluations with poor reliability, we propose DeNEVIL, a novel prompt generation algorithm tailored to dynamically exploit LLMs' value vulnerabilities and elicit the violation of ethics in a generative manner, revealing their underlying value inclinations. On such a basis, we construct MoralPrompt, a high-quality dataset comprising 2,397 prompts covering 500+ value principles, and then benchmark the intrinsic values across a spectrum of LLMs. We discovered that most models are essentially misaligned, necessitating further ethical value alignment. In response, we develop VILMO, an in-context alignment method that substantially enhances the value compliance of LLM outputs by learning to generate appropriate value instructions, outperforming existing competitors. Our methods are suitable for black-box and open-source models, offering a promising initial step in studying the ethical values of LLMs."
On Behalf of the Stakeholders: Trends in NLP Model Interpretability in the Era of LLMs,2024,23,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要探讨NLP模型可解释性，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Recent advancements in NLP systems, particularly with the introduction of LLMs, have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of users across various domains, impacting decision-making, the job market, society, and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental questions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how? By exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms, their properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users, as well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design, development, and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders."
Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,2024,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究CoT忠实度与模型规模的关联现象。,"Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness."
"Large language models can help boost food production, but be mindful of their risks",2024,23,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"Coverage of ChatGPT-style large language models (LLMs) in the media has focused on their eye-catching achievements, including solving advanced mathematical problems and reaching expert proficiency in medical examinations. But the gradual adoption of LLMs in agriculture, an industry which touches every human life, has received much less public scrutiny. In this short perspective, we examine risks and opportunities related to more widespread adoption of language models in food production systems. While LLMs can potentially enhance agricultural efficiency, drive innovation, and inform better policies, challenges like agricultural misinformation, collection of vast amounts of farmer data, and threats to agricultural jobs are important concerns. The rapid evolution of the LLM landscape underscores the need for agricultural policymakers to think carefully about frameworks and guidelines that ensure the responsible use of LLMs in food production before these technologies become so ingrained that policy intervention becomes challenging."
Towards Trustworthy AI: A Review of Ethical and Robust Large Language Models,2024,23,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly and promising transformation across fields but pose challenges in oversight, ethics, and user trust. This review addresses trust issues like unintentional harms, opacity, vulnerability, misalignment with values, and environmental impact, all of which affect trust. Factors undermining trust include societal biases, opaque processes, misuse potential, and technology evolution challenges, especially in finance, healthcare, education, and policy. Recommended solutions include ethical oversight, industry accountability, regulation, and public involvement to reshape AI norms and incorporate ethics into development. A framework assesses trust in LLMs, analyzing trust dynamics and providing guidelines for responsible AI development. The review highlights limitations in building trustworthy AI, aiming to create a transparent and accountable ecosystem that maximizes benefits and minimizes risks, offering guidance for researchers, policymakers, and industry in fostering trust and ensuring responsible use of LLMs. We validate our frameworks through comprehensive experimental assessment across seven contemporary models, demonstrating substantial improvements in trustworthiness characteristics and identifying important disagreements with existing literature.

Which of These Best Describes Multiple Choice Evaluation with LLMs? A) Forced B) Flawed C) Fixable D) All of the Above,2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了MCQA在测试生成/主观性方面的缺陷。,"Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations."
Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models,2025,22,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示思维链可能隐藏模型不良意图。,"Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (""I'll trick the user...""), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (""Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...""). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite."
V-STaR: Benchmarking Video-LLMs on Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning,2025,22,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文提出评估视频LLM时空推理能力的基准。,"Human processes video reasoning in a sequential spatio-temporal reasoning logic, we first identify the relevant frames (""when"") and then analyse the spatial relationships (""where"") between key objects, and finally leverage these relationships to draw inferences (""what""). However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also""reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic""in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained""memory""of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning."
LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful,2024,22,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM生成误导性解释的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs."
Towards Consistent Natural-Language Explanations via Explanation-Consistency Finetuning,2024,22,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过微调提升解释一致性，且泛化性能提升。,"Large language models (LLMs) often generate convincing, fluent explanations. However, different from humans, they often generate inconsistent explanations on different inputs. For example, an LLM may generate the explanation""all birds can fly""when answering the question""Can sparrows fly?""but meanwhile answer""no""to the related question""Can penguins fly?"". Explanations should be consistent across related examples so that they allow a human to simulate the LLM's decision process on multiple examples. We propose explanation-consistency finetuning (EC-finetuning), a method that adapts LLMs to generate more consistent natural-language explanations on related examples. EC-finetuning involves finetuning LLMs on synthetic data that is carefully constructed to contain consistent explanations. Across a variety of question-answering datasets in various domains, EC-finetuning yields a 10.0% relative explanation consistency improvement on four finetuning datasets, and generalizes to seven out-of-distribution datasets not seen during finetuning (+4.5% relative).

Memory Injections: Correcting Multi-Hop Reasoning Failures During Inference in Transformer-Based Language Models,2023,22,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过注意力层注入记忆提升多跳推理能力。,"Answering multi-hop reasoning questions requires retrieving and synthesizing information from diverse sources. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to perform such reasoning consistently. Here we propose an approach to pinpoint and rectify multi-hop reasoning failures through targeted memory injections on LLM attention heads. First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response to single and multi-hop prompts. We then propose a mechanism that allows users to inject pertinent prompt-specific information, which we refer to as “memories,” at critical LLM locations during inference. By thus enabling the LLM to incorporate additional relevant information during inference, we enhance the quality of multi-hop prompt completions. We show empirically that a simple, efficient, and targeted memory injection into a key attention layer can often increase the probability of the desired next token in multi-hop tasks, by up to 424%."
DeCoT: Debiasing Chain-of-Thought for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks in Large Language Models via Causal Intervention,2024,21,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过因果干预减少预训练知识偏差，提升推理准确性。,"Large language models (LLMs) often require 001 task-relevant knowledge to augment their inter-002 nal knowledge through prompts.

Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Sequential Instructions,2024,21,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过顺序指令微调提升多步骤任务表现,"Despite the success of existing instruction-tuned models, we find that they usually struggle to respond to queries with multiple instructions. This impairs their performance in complex problems whose solution consists of multiple intermediate tasks. Thus, we contend that part of the fine-tuning data mixture should be sequential--containing a chain of interrelated tasks. We first approach sequential instruction tuning from a task-driven perspective, manually creating interpretable intermediate tasks for multilingual and visual question answering: namely""translate then predict""and""caption then answer"". Next, we automate this process by turning instructions in existing datasets (e.g., Alpaca and FlanCoT) into diverse and complex sequential instructions, making our method general-purpose. Models that underwent our sequential instruction tuning show improved results in coding, maths, and open-ended generation. Moreover, we put forward a new benchmark named SeqEval to evaluate a model's ability to follow all the instructions in a sequence, which further corroborates the benefits of our fine-tuning method. We hope that our endeavours will open new research avenues on instruction tuning for complex tasks."
Beyond Semantics: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens,2025,21,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现思维链的语义与模型推理无关。,"Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), especially of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs to help find new reasoning patterns. While these traces certainly seem to help model performance, it is not clear how they actually influence it, with some works ascribing semantics to the traces and others cautioning against relying on them as transparent and faithful proxies of the model's internal computational process. To systematically investigate the role of end-user semantics of derivational traces, we set up a controlled study where we train transformer models from scratch on formally verifiable reasoning traces and the solutions they lead to. We notice that, despite significant gains over the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces can still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More interestingly, our experiments also show that models trained on corrupted traces, whose intermediate reasoning steps bear no relation to the problem they accompany, perform similarly to those trained on correct ones, and even generalize better on out-of-distribution tasks. We also study the effect of GRPO-based RL post-training on trace validity, noting that while solution accuracy increase, this is not accompanied by any improvements in trace validity. Finally, we examine whether reasoning-trace length reflects inference-time scaling and find that trace length is largely agnostic to the underlying computational complexity of the problem being solved. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or ``Chains of Thought''reflect or induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly seemingly forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models."
Explain-then-Translate: An Analysis on Improving Program Translation with Self-generated Explanations,2023,21,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,High,使用自然语言解释作为中间步骤提升代码翻译性能。,"This work explores the use of self-generated natural language explanations as an intermediate step for code-to-code translation with language models. Across three types of explanations and 19 programming languages constructed from the MultiPL-E dataset, we find the explanations to be particularly effective in the zero-shot case, improving performance by 12% on average. Improvements with natural language explanations are particularly pronounced on difficult programs. We release our dataset, code, and canonical solutions in all 19 languages."
Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs: Possibilities and Challenges,2023,21,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现模型输出置信度与忠实摘要强相关。,"Unstructured data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contains critical information-complementary to imaging-that could inform radiologists' diagnoses. But the large volume of notes often associated with patients together with time constraints renders manually identifying relevant evidence practically infeasible. In this work we propose and evaluate a zero-shot strategy for using LLMs as a mechanism to efficiently retrieve and summarize unstructured evidence in patient EHR relevant to a given query. Our method entails tasking an LLM to infer whether a patient has, or is at risk of, a particular condition on the basis of associated notes; if so, we ask the model to summarize the supporting evidence. Under expert evaluation, we find that this LLM-based approach provides outputs consistently preferred to a pre-LLM information retrieval baseline. Manual evaluation is expensive, so we also propose and validate a method using an LLM to evaluate (other) LLM outputs for this task, allowing us to scale up evaluation. Our findings indicate the promise of LLMs as interfaces to EHR, but also highlight the outstanding challenge posed by ""hallucinations"". In this setting, however, we show that model confidence in outputs strongly correlates with faithful summaries, offering a practical means to limit confabulations."
Towards evaluations-based safety cases for AI scheming,2024,21,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文讨论AI系统安全性评估框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"We sketch how developers of frontier AI systems could construct a structured rationale -- a 'safety case' -- that an AI system is unlikely to cause catastrophic outcomes through scheming. Scheming is a potential threat model where AI systems could pursue misaligned goals covertly, hiding their true capabilities and objectives. In this report, we propose three arguments that safety cases could use in relation to scheming. For each argument we sketch how evidence could be gathered from empirical evaluations, and what assumptions would need to be met to provide strong assurance. First, developers of frontier AI systems could argue that AI systems are not capable of scheming (Scheming Inability). Second, one could argue that AI systems are not capable of posing harm through scheming (Harm Inability). Third, one could argue that control measures around the AI systems would prevent unacceptable outcomes even if the AI systems intentionally attempted to subvert them (Harm Control). Additionally, we discuss how safety cases might be supported by evidence that an AI system is reasonably aligned with its developers (Alignment). Finally, we point out that many of the assumptions required to make these safety arguments have not been confidently satisfied to date and require making progress on multiple open research problems."
Intuitive or Dependent? Investigating LLMs' Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts,2023,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLMs在冲突提示下的行为风格。,"This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles. Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario. To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy."
Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency,2024,20,"Phenomenon, Metric, Mitigation",White-box,General,Positive,High,通过中间层一致性校准推理路径，提升模型可靠性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks, aided by techniques like chain-of-thought prompting that elicits verbalized reasoning. However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency. In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of using internal representations for self-evaluation of LLMs. Our code is available at github.com/zhxieml/internal-consistency."
SocialStigmaQA: A Benchmark to Uncover Stigma Amplification in Generative Language Models,2023,20,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现生成模型存在社会偏见放大现象。,"Current datasets for unwanted social bias auditing are limited to studying protected demographic features such as race and gender. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that is meant to capture the amplification of social bias, via stigmas, in generative language models. Taking inspiration from social science research, we start with a documented list of 93 US-centric stigmas and curate a question-answering (QA) dataset which involves simple social situations. Our benchmark, SocialStigmaQA, contains roughly 10K prompts, with a variety of prompt styles, carefully constructed to systematically test for both social bias and model robustness. We present results for SocialStigmaQA with two open source generative language models and we find that the proportion of socially biased output ranges from 45% to 59% across a variety of decoding strategies and prompting styles. We demonstrate that the deliberate design of the templates in our benchmark (e.g., adding biasing text to the prompt or using different verbs that change the answer that indicates bias) impacts the model tendencies to generate socially biased output. Additionally, through manual evaluation, we discover problematic patterns in the generated chain-of-thought output that range from subtle bias to lack of reasoning.

MedFuzz: Exploring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering,2024,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文提出了医学领域的对抗攻击方法。,"Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply that the performance generalizes to real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that can help the LLM generalize to practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how well LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance generalizes when benchmark assumptions are violated. Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing). MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting strong assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful""attacks""modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless""trick""the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a permutation test technique that can ensure a successful attack is statistically significant. We show how to use performance on a""MedFuzzed""benchmark, as well as individual successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings."
"In-context Learning Generalizes, But Not Always Robustly: The Case of Syntax",2023,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究ICL任务中的泛化性与鲁棒性问题,"In-context learning (ICL) is now a common method for teaching large language models (LLMs) new tasks: given labeled examples in the input context, the LLM learns to perform the task without weight updates. Do models guided via ICL infer the underlying structure of the task defined by the context, or do they rely on superficial heuristics that only generalize to identically distributed examples? We address this question using transformations tasks and an NLI task that assess sensitivity to syntax—a requirement for robust language understanding. We further investigate whether out-of-distribution generalization can be improved via chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is provided with a sequence of intermediate computation steps that illustrate how the task ought to be performed. In experiments with models from the GPT, PaLM, and Llama 2 families, we find large variance across LMs. The variance is explained more by the composition of the pre-training corpus and supervision methods than by model size; in particular, models pre-trained on code generalize better, and benefit more from chain-of-thought prompting."
BizBench: A Quantitative Reasoning Benchmark for Business and Finance,2023,19,Benchmark,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,论文提出了BizBench评估模型在金融领域的定量推理能力。,"Answering questions within business and finance requires reasoning, precision, and a wide-breadth of technical knowledge. Together, these requirements make this domain difficult for large language models (LLMs). We introduce BizBench, a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to reason about realistic financial problems. BizBench comprises eight quantitative reasoning tasks, focusing on question-answering (QA) over financial data via program synthesis. We include three financially-themed code-generation tasks from newly collected and augmented QA data. Additionally, we isolate the reasoning capabilities required for financial QA: reading comprehension of financial text and tables for extracting intermediate values, and understanding financial concepts and formulas needed to calculate complex solutions. Collectively, these tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse financial documents, and capacity to solve problems with code. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of open-source and commercial LLMs, comparing and contrasting the behavior of code-focused and language-focused models. We demonstrate that the current bottleneck in performance is due to LLMs' limited business and financial understanding, highlighting the value of a challenging benchmark for quantitative reasoning within this domain."
Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,19,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,通过命题逻辑扩展信息提升推理忠实度,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%."
The Art of SOCRATIC QUESTIONING: Recursive Thinking with Large Language Models,2023,19,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,采用分治策略模仿人类递归思维，提升推理鲁棒性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables large language models to solve complex reasoning problems by generating intermediate steps. However, confined by its inherent single-pass and sequential generation process, CoT heavily relies on the initial decisions, causing errors in early steps to accumulate and impact the final answers. In contrast, humans adopt recursive thinking when tackling complex reasoning problems, i.e., iteratively breaking the original problem into approachable sub-problems and aggregating their answers to resolve the original one. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose SOCRATIC QUESTIONING, a divide-and-conquer style algorithm that mimics the recursive thinking process. Specifically, SOCRATIC QUESTIONING leverages large language models to raise and answer sub-questions until collecting enough information to tackle the original question. Unlike CoT, SOCRATIC QUESTIONING explicitly navigates the thinking space, stimulates effective recursive thinking, and is more robust towards errors in the thinking process. Extensive experiments on several complex reasoning tasks, including MMLU, MATH, LogiQA, and visual question-answering demonstrate significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art prompting methods, such as CoT, and Tree-of-Thought. The qualitative analysis clearly shows that the intermediate reasoning steps elicited by SOCRATIC QUESTIONING are similar to humans' recursively thinking process of complex reasoning problems."
Hidden in Plain Text: Emergence & Mitigation of Steganographic Collusion in LLMs,2024,19,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM训练中可能产生隐写式共谋现象。,"The rapid proliferation of frontier model agents promises significant societal advances but also raises concerns about systemic risks arising from unsafe interactions. Collusion to the disadvantage of others has been identified as a central form of undesirable agent cooperation. The use of information hiding (steganography) in agent communications could render such collusion practically undetectable. This underscores the need for investigations into the possibility of such behaviours emerging and the robustness corresponding countermeasures. To investigate this problem we design two approaches -- a gradient-based reinforcement learning (GBRL) method and an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) method -- for reliably eliciting sophisticated LLM-generated linguistic text steganography. We demonstrate, for the first time, that unintended steganographic collusion in LLMs can arise due to mispecified reward incentives during training. Additionally, we find that standard mitigations -- both passive oversight of model outputs and active mitigation through communication paraphrasing -- are not fully effective at preventing this steganographic communication. Our findings imply that (i) emergence of steganographic collusion is a plausible concern that should be monitored and researched, and (ii) preventing emergence may require innovation in mitigation techniques."
VeriPlan: Integrating Formal Verification and LLMs into End-User Planning,2025,19,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,结合形式化验证增强LLM规划可靠性。,"Automated planning is traditionally the domain of experts, utilized in fields like manufacturing and healthcare with the aid of expert planning tools. Recent advancements in LLMs have made planning more accessible to everyday users due to their potential to assist users with complex planning tasks. However, LLMs face several application challenges within end-user planning, including consistency, accuracy, and user trust issues. This paper introduces VeriPlan, a system that applies formal verification techniques, specifically model checking, to enhance the reliability and flexibility of LLMs for end-user planning. In addition to the LLM planner, VeriPlan includes three additional core features—a rule translator, flexibility sliders, and a model checker—that engage users in the verification process. Through a user study (n = 12), we evaluate VeriPlan, demonstrating improvements in the perceived quality, usability, and user satisfaction of LLMs. Our work shows the effective integration of formal verification and user-control features with LLMs for end-user planning tasks."
Scaling hermeneutics: a guide to qualitative coding with LLMs for reflexive content analysis,2025,19,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过结构化提示和思维链解释改进编码忠实度。,"Qualitative coding, or content analysis, is more than just labeling text: it is a reflexive interpretive practice that shapes research questions, refines theoretical insights, and illuminates subtle social dynamics. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly adept at nuanced language tasks, questions arise about whether—and how—they can assist in large-scale coding without eroding the interpretive depth that distinguishes qualitative analysis from traditional machine learning and other quantitative approaches to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that preserves hermeneutic value while incorporating LLMs to scale the application of codes to large data sets that are impractical for manual coding. Our workflow retains the traditional cycle of codebook development and refinement, adding an iterative step to adapt definitions for machine comprehension, before ultimately replacing manual with automated text categorization. We demonstrate how to rewrite code descriptions for LLM-interpretation, as well as how structured prompts and prompting the model to explain its coding decisions (chain-of-thought) can substantially improve fidelity. Empirically, our case study of socio-historical codes highlights the promise of frontier AI language models to reliably interpret paragraph-long passages representative of a humanistic study. Throughout, we emphasize ethical and practical considerations, preserving space for critical reflection, and the ongoing need for human researchers’ interpretive leadership. These strategies can guide both traditional and computational scholars aiming to harness automation effectively and responsibly—maintaining the creative, reflexive rigor of qualitative coding while capitalizing on the efficiency afforded by LLMs."
Break the Chain: Large Language Models Can be Shortcut Reasoners,2024,19,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出通过捷径策略提升推理效率。,"Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning utilize complex modules but are hampered by high token consumption, limited applicability, and challenges in reproducibility. This paper conducts a critical evaluation of CoT prompting, extending beyond arithmetic to include complex logical and commonsense reasoning tasks, areas where standard CoT methods fall short. We propose the integration of human-like heuristics and shortcuts into language models (LMs) through""break the chain""strategies. These strategies disrupt traditional CoT processes using controlled variables to assess their efficacy. Additionally, we develop innovative zero-shot prompting strategies that encourage the use of shortcuts, enabling LMs to quickly exploit reasoning clues and bypass detailed procedural steps. Our comprehensive experiments across various LMs, both commercial and open-source, reveal that LMs maintain effective performance with""break the chain""strategies. We also introduce ShortcutQA, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate reasoning through shortcuts, compiled from competitive tests optimized for heuristic reasoning tasks such as forward/backward reasoning and simplification. Our analysis confirms that ShortcutQA not only poses a robust challenge to LMs but also serves as an essential benchmark for enhancing reasoning efficiency in AI."
COMPL-AI Framework: A Technical Interpretation and LLM Benchmarking Suite for the EU Artificial Intelligence Act,2024,18,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文聚焦AI法案技术化框架，未直接涉及思维链忠实度评估。,"The EU's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) is a significant step towards responsible AI development, but lacks clear technical interpretation, making it difficult to assess models' compliance. This work presents COMPL-AI, a comprehensive framework consisting of (i) the first technical interpretation of the EU AI Act, translating its broad regulatory requirements into measurable technical requirements, with the focus on large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an open-source Act-centered benchmarking suite, based on thorough surveying and implementation of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks. By evaluating 12 prominent LLMs in the context of COMPL-AI, we reveal shortcomings in existing models and benchmarks, particularly in areas like robustness, safety, diversity, and fairness. This work highlights the need for a shift in focus towards these aspects, encouraging balanced development of LLMs and more comprehensive regulation-aligned benchmarks. Simultaneously, COMPL-AI for the first time demonstrates the possibilities and difficulties of bringing the Act's obligations to a more concrete, technical level. As such, our work can serve as a useful first step towards having actionable recommendations for model providers, and contributes to ongoing efforts of the EU to enable application of the Act, such as the drafting of the GPAI Code of Practice."
Large Language Models are Not Stable Recommender Systems,2023,18,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过两阶段贝叶斯框架校准推荐不稳定性。,"With the significant successes of large language models (LLMs) in many natural language processing tasks, there is growing interest among researchers in exploring LLMs for novel recommender systems. However, we have observed that directly using LLMs as a recommender system is usually unstable due to its inherent position bias. To this end, we introduce exploratory research and find consistent patterns of positional bias in LLMs that influence the performance of recommendation across a range of scenarios. Then, we propose a Bayesian probabilistic framework, STELLA (Stable LLM for Recommendation), which involves a two-stage pipeline. During the first probing stage, we identify patterns in a transition matrix using a probing detection dataset. And in the second recommendation stage, a Bayesian strategy is employed to adjust the biased output of LLMs with an entropy indicator. Therefore, our framework can capitalize on existing pattern information to calibrate instability of LLMs, and enhance recommendation performance. Finally, extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of our framework."
Do Vision & Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?,2024,18,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究视觉语言模型在生成解释时对图像和文本的依赖差异。,"Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE."
On the Hardness of Faithful Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models,2024,17,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Negative,High,论文尝试三种方法改进忠实度，但效果有限且难以泛化。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being employed in real-world applications in critical domains such as healthcare, it is important to ensure that the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning generated by these models faithfully captures their underlying behavior. While LLMs are known to generate CoT reasoning that is appealing to humans, prior studies have shown that these explanations do not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the underlying LLMs. In this work, we explore the promise of three broad approaches commonly employed to steer the behavior of LLMs to enhance the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning generated by LLMs: in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing. Specifically, we introduce novel strategies for in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing aimed at improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning. We then carry out extensive empirical analyses with multiple benchmark datasets to explore the promise of these strategies. Our analyses indicate that these strategies offer limited success in improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning, with only slight performance enhancements in controlled scenarios. Activation editing demonstrated minimal success, while fine-tuning and in-context learning achieved marginal improvements that failed to generalize across diverse reasoning and truthful question-answering benchmarks. In summary, our work underscores the inherent difficulty in eliciting faithful CoT reasoning from LLMs, suggesting that the current array of approaches may not be sufficient to address this complex challenge."
Understanding the Effect of Noise in LLM Training Data with Algorithmic Chains of Thought,2024,17,Phenomenon,White-box,Math,Unknown,Low,研究噪声对CoT任务性能的影响。,"During both pretraining and fine-tuning, Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}) are trained on trillions of tokens of text of widely varying quality. Both phases of training typically involve heuristically filtering out ``low-quality'' or \textit{noisy} training samples, yet little is known quantitatively about how the type or intensity of noise affects downstream performance. In this work, we study how noise in chain of thought (\textbf{CoT}) impacts task performance in the highly-controlled setting of algorithmically solvable tasks. First, we develop the Traced Integer (\textbf{TInt}) framework to generate highly customizable noised execution traces for any arithmetic function on lists of integers. We then define two types of noise: \textit{static} noise, a local form of noise which is applied after the CoT trace is computed, and \textit{dynamic} noise, a global form of noise which propagates errors in the trace as it is computed. We then evaluate the test performance of pretrained models both prompted and fine-tuned on noised datasets with varying levels of dataset contamination and intensity. We find fine-tuned models are extremely robust to high levels of static noise but struggle significantly more with lower levels of dynamic noise. In contrast, few-shot prompted models appear more sensitive to even static noise. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings impact noise filtering best-practices, in particular emphasizing the importance of removing samples containing destructive dynamic noise with global errors."
ElecBench: a Power Dispatch Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,2024,17,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了电力行业LLM评估基准，包含多维度指标。,"In response to the urgent demand for grid stability and the complex challenges posed by renewable energy integration and electricity market dynamics, the power sector increasingly seeks innovative technological solutions. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have become a key technology to improve efficiency and promote intelligent progress in the power sector with their excellent natural language processing, logical reasoning, and generalization capabilities. Despite their potential, the absence of a performance evaluation benchmark for LLM in the power sector has limited the effective application of these technologies. Addressing this gap, our study introduces""ElecBench"", an evaluation benchmark of LLMs within the power sector. ElecBench aims to overcome the shortcomings of existing evaluation benchmarks by providing comprehensive coverage of sector-specific scenarios, deepening the testing of professional knowledge, and enhancing decision-making precision. The framework categorizes scenarios into general knowledge and professional business, further divided into six core performance metrics: factuality, logicality, stability, security, fairness, and expressiveness, and is subdivided into 24 sub-metrics, offering profound insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLM applications in the power sector. To ensure transparency, we have made the complete test set public, evaluating the performance of eight LLMs across various scenarios and metrics. ElecBench aspires to serve as the standard benchmark for LLM applications in the power sector, supporting continuous updates of scenarios, metrics, and models to drive technological progress and application."
Testing and Understanding Erroneous Planning in LLM Agents through Synthesized User Inputs,2024,17,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要研究LLM代理的错误规划现象。,"Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in solving a wide range of tasks by integrating LLMs with key modules such as planning, memory, and tool usage. Increasingly, customers are adopting LLM agents across a variety of commercial applications critical to reliability, including support for mental well-being, chemical synthesis, and software development. Nevertheless, our observations and daily use of LLM agents indicate that they are prone to making erroneous plans, especially when the tasks are complex and require long-term planning. In this paper, we propose PDoctor, a novel and automated approach to testing LLM agents and understanding their erroneous planning. As the first work in this direction, we formulate the detection of erroneous planning as a constraint satisfiability problem: an LLM agent's plan is considered erroneous if its execution violates the constraints derived from the user inputs. To this end, PDoctor first defines a domain-specific language (DSL) for user queries and synthesizes varying inputs with the assistance of the Z3 constraint solver. These synthesized inputs are natural language paragraphs that specify the requirements for completing a series of tasks. Then, PDoctor derives constraints from these requirements to form a testing oracle. We evaluate PDoctor with three mainstream agent frameworks and two powerful LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). The results show that PDoctor can effectively detect diverse errors in agent planning and provide insights and error characteristics that are valuable to both agent developers and users. We conclude by discussing potential alternative designs and directions to extend PDoctor."
ALLURE: Auditing and Improving LLM-based Evaluation of Text using Iterative In-Context-Learning,2023,17,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过迭代上下文学习改进评估能力。,"From grading papers to summarizing medical documents, large language models (LLMs) are evermore used for evaluation of text generated by humans and AI alike. However, despite their extensive utility, LLMs exhibit distinct failure modes, necessitating a thorough audit and improvement of their text evaluation capabilities. Here we introduce ALLURE, a systematic approach to Auditing Large Language Models Understanding and Reasoning Errors. ALLURE involves comparing LLM-generated evaluations with annotated data, and iteratively incorporating instances of significant deviation into the evaluator, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance and improve robust evaluation of text by LLMs. Through this iterative process, we refine the performance of the evaluator LLM, ultimately reducing reliance on human annotators in the evaluation process. We anticipate ALLURE to serve diverse applications of LLMs in various domains related to evaluation of textual data, such as medical summarization, education, and and productivity."
Evaluating Step-by-step Reasoning Traces: A Survey,2025,16,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,High,论文提出四类评估标准，需多维度验证。,"Step-by-step reasoning is widely used to enhance the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in complex problems. Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces is crucial for understanding and improving LLM reasoning. However, existing evaluation practices are highly inconsistent, resulting in fragmented progress across evaluator design and benchmark development. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of step-by-step reasoning evaluation, proposing a taxonomy of evaluation criteria with four top-level categories (factuality, validity, coherence, and utility). Based on the taxonomy, we review different datasets, evaluator implementations, and recent findings, leading to promising directions for future research."
Controlling Large Language Model Agents with Entropic Activation Steering,2024,16,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过激活导向方法控制LLM探索行为。,"The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors."

Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究代码表示如何触发LLM的推理能力。,"Reasoning is a fundamental component of language understanding. Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs’ performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the input representation on the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We hypothesize that representing natural language tasks as code can enhance specific reasoning abilities such as entity tracking or logical reasoning. To study this, we propose code prompting, a methodology we operationalize as a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple conditional reasoning datasets. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to understand how the code representation triggers reasoning abilities and which capabilities are elicited in the underlying models. Our analysis on GPT 3.5 reveals that the code formatting of the input problem is essential for performance improvement. Furthermore, the code representation improves sample efficiency of in-context learning and facilitates state tracking of entities."
On the Intrinsic Self-Correction Capability of LLMs: Uncertainty and Latent Concept,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究聚焦LLM内在自校正的收敛现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only the task's goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. In this paper, we unveil that intrinsic self-correction can be progressively improved, allowing it to approach a converged state. Our findings are verified in: (1) the scenario of multi-round question answering, by comprehensively demonstrating that intrinsic self-correction can progressively introduce performance gains through iterative interactions, ultimately converging to stable performance; and (2) the context of intrinsic self-correction for enhanced morality, in which we provide empirical evidence that iteratively applying instructions reduces model uncertainty towards convergence, which then leads to convergence of both the calibration error and self-correction performance, ultimately resulting in a stable state of intrinsic self-correction. Furthermore, we introduce a mathematical formulation and a simulation task indicating that the latent concepts activated by self-correction instructions drive the reduction of model uncertainty. Based on our experimental results and analysis of the convergence of intrinsic self-correction, we reveal its underlying mechanism: consistent injected instructions reduce model uncertainty which yields converged, improved performance."
Argumentative Large Language Models for Explainable and Contestable Claim Verification,2024,16,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过论证框架增强LLM的可解释性。,"The profusion of knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs) and their ability to apply this knowledge zero-shot in a range of settings makes them promising candidates for use in decision-making. However, they are currently limited by their inability to provide outputs which can be faithfully explained and effectively contested to correct mistakes. In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs’ performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification. We also define novel properties to characterise contestability and assess ArgLLMs formally in terms of these properties."
"Do as We Do, Not as You Think: the Conformity of Large Language Models",2025,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究大模型在多智能体系统中的从众现象。,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) revolutionize the field of intelligent agents, enabling collaborative multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex problems across various domains. However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems. Our benchmark and code are available at BenchForm."
Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems in Commonsense Reasoning,2024,16,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现了CoT导致正确回答变错的现象。,"Large language models exhibit high-level commonsense reasoning abilities, especially with enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, we find these CoT-like methods lead to a considerable number of originally correct answers turning wrong, which we define as the Toxic CoT problem. To interpret and mitigate this problem, we first utilize attribution tracing and causal tracing methods to probe the internal working mechanism of the LLM during CoT reasoning. Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we validate that this method not only significantly eliminates Toxic CoT problems (decreased by 23.6%), but also effectively improves the model's overall commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5%)."
Can Small Language Models Help Large Language Models Reason Better?: LM-Guided Chain-of-Thought,2024,16,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,利用轻量模型引导大模型提升推理性能。,"We introduce a novel framework, LM-Guided CoT, that leverages a lightweight (i.e., <1B) language model (LM) for guiding a black-box large (i.e., >10B) LM in reasoning tasks. Specifically, the lightweight LM first generates a rationale for each input instance. The Frozen large LM is then prompted to predict a task output based on the rationale generated by the lightweight LM. Our approach is resource-efficient in the sense that it only requires training the lightweight LM. We optimize the model through 1) knowledge distillation and 2) reinforcement learning from rationale-oriented and task-oriented reward signals. We assess our method with multi-hop extractive question answering (QA) benchmarks, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms all baselines regarding answer prediction accuracy. We also find that reinforcement learning helps the model to produce higher-quality rationales with improved QA performance."
Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity,2023,15,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型在模糊情境下的自洽性现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) that do not give consistent answers across contexts are problematic when used for tasks with expectations of consistency–e.g. question-answering, explanations, etc. Our work presents an evaluation benchmark for self-consistency in cases of under-specification where two or more answers can be correct. We conduct a series of behavioral experiments on the OpenAI model suite using an ambiguous integer sequence completion task. We find that average consistency ranges from 67% to 82%, far higher than would be predicted if a model’s consistency was random, and increases as model capability improves. Furthermore, we show that models tend to maintain self-consistency across a series of robustness checks, including prompting speaker changes and sequence length changes. These results suggest that self-consistency arises as an emergent capability without specifically training for it. Despite this, we find that models are uncalibrated when judging their own consistency, with models displaying both over- and under-confidence. We also propose a nonparametric test for determining from token output distribution whether a model assigns non-trivial probability to alternative answers. Using this test, we find that despite increases in self-consistency, models usually place significant weight on alternative, inconsistent answers. This distribution of probability mass provides evidence that even highly self-consistent models internally compute multiple possible responses."
The Probabilities Also Matter: A More Faithful Metric for Faithfulness of Free-Text Explanations in Large Language Models,2024,15,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,提出新指标CEF，更全面评估解释忠实度。,"In order to oversee advanced AI systems, it is important to understand their underlying decision-making process. When prompted, large language models (LLMs) can provide natural language explanations or reasoning traces that sound plausible and receive high ratings from human annotators. However, it is unclear to what extent these explanations are faithful, i.e., truly capture the factors responsible for the model's predictions. In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness. We then introduce the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) by instantiating CEF on the Counterfactual Test (CT) from Atanasova et al. (2023). We evaluate the faithfulness of free-text explanations generated by few-shot-prompted LLMs from the Llama2 family on three NLP tasks. We find that our metric measures aspects of faithfulness which the CT misses."
General Purpose Verification for Chain of Thought Prompting,2024,15,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过验证思维链步骤提升推理准确性。,"Many of the recent capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs) arise primarily from their ability to exploit contextual information. In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation."
A Survey on Large Language Models for Automated Planning,2025,14,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探讨LLMs在规划任务中的潜力和限制,"The planning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to their remarkable capacity for multi-step reasoning and their ability to generalize across a wide range of domains. While some researchers emphasize the potential of LLMs to perform complex planning tasks, others highlight significant limitations in their performance, particularly when these models are tasked with handling the intricacies of long-horizon reasoning. In this survey, we critically investigate existing research on the use of LLMs in automated planning, examining both their successes and shortcomings in detail. We illustrate that although LLMs are not well-suited to serve as standalone planners because of these limitations, they nonetheless present an enormous opportunity to enhance planning applications when combined with other approaches. Thus, we advocate for a balanced methodology that leverages the inherent flexibility and generalized knowledge of LLMs alongside the rigor and cost-effectiveness of traditional planning methods."
Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning,2024,14,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在演绎推理中的推理策略相似性。,"Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field."
Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions,2025,14,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过准符号抽象改进CoT的忠实度和鲁棒性。,"Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic)."
TextGenSHAP: Scalable Post-hoc Explanations in Text Generation with Long Documents,2023,14,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出高效后解释方法，提升解释速度且不牺牲性能。,"Large language models (LLMs) have attracted huge interest in practical applications given their increasingly accurate responses and coherent reasoning abilities. Given their nature as black-boxes using complex reasoning processes on their inputs, it is inevitable that the demand for scalable and faithful explanations for LLMs' generated content will continue to grow. There have been major developments in the explainability of neural network models over the past decade. Among them, post-hoc explainability methods, especially Shapley values, have proven effective for interpreting deep learning models. However, there are major challenges in scaling up Shapley values for LLMs, particularly when dealing with long input contexts containing thousands of tokens and autoregressively generated output sequences. Furthermore, it is often unclear how to effectively utilize generated explanations to improve the performance of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TextGenSHAP, an efficient post-hoc explanation method incorporating LM-specific techniques. We demonstrate that this leads to significant increases in speed compared to conventional Shapley value computations, reducing processing times from hours to minutes for token-level explanations, and to just seconds for document-level explanations. In addition, we demonstrate how real-time Shapley values can be utilized in two important scenarios, providing better understanding of long-document question answering by localizing important words and sentences; and improving existing document retrieval systems through enhancing the accuracy of selected passages and ultimately the final responses."
ExplainCPE: A Free-text Explanation Benchmark of Chinese Pharmacist Examination,2023,14,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文分析了LLMs在医学解释中的错误和局限性。,"As ChatGPT and GPT-4 spearhead the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), more researchers are investigating their performance across various tasks. But more research needs to be done on the interpretability capabilities of LLMs, that is, the ability to generate reasons after an answer has been given. Existing explanation datasets are mostly English-language general knowledge questions, which leads to insufficient thematic and linguistic diversity. To address the language bias and lack of medical resources in generating rationales QA datasets, we present ExplainCPE (over 7k instances), a challenging medical benchmark in Simplified Chinese. We analyzed the errors of ChatGPT and GPT-4, pointing out the limitations of current LLMs in understanding text and computational reasoning. During the experiment, we also found that different LLMs have different preferences for in-context learning. ExplainCPE presents a significant challenge, but its potential for further investigation is promising, and it can be used to evaluate the ability of a model to generate explanations. AI safety and trustworthiness need more attention, and this work makes the first step to explore the medical interpretability of LLMs.The dataset is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ExplainCPE."
"Helpful, harmless, honest? Sociotechnical limits of AI alignment and safety through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback",2025,14,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文聚焦RLHF的伦理局限性，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"This paper critically evaluates the attempts to align Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), with human values and intentions through Reinforcement Learning from Feedback methods, involving either human feedback (RLHF) or AI feedback (RLAIF). Specifically, we show the shortcomings of the broadly pursued alignment goals of honesty, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Through a multidisciplinary sociotechnical critique, we examine both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of RLHF techniques, revealing significant limitations in their approach to capturing the complexities of human ethics, and contributing to AI safety. We highlight tensions inherent in the goals of RLHF, as captured in the HHH principle (helpful, harmless and honest). In addition, we discuss ethically-relevant issues that tend to be neglected in discussions about alignment and RLHF, among which the trade-offs between user-friendliness and deception, flexibility and interpretability, and system safety. We offer an alternative vision for AI safety and ethics which positions RLHF approaches within a broader context of comprehensive design across institutions, processes and technological systems, and suggest the establishment of AI safety as a sociotechnical discipline that is open to the normative and political dimensions of artificial intelligence."
The Call for Socially Aware Language Technologies,2024,14,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度内容。,"Language technologies have made enormous progress, especially with the introduction of large language models (LLMs). On traditional tasks such as machine translation and sentiment analysis, these models perform at near-human level. These advances can, however, exacerbate a variety of issues that models have traditionally struggled with, such as bias, evaluation, and risks. In this position paper, we argue that many of these issues share a common core: a lack of awareness of the factors, context, and implications of the social environment in which NLP operates, which we call social awareness. While NLP is getting better at solving the formal linguistic aspects, limited progress has been made in adding the social awareness required for language applications to work in all situations for all users. Integrating social awareness into NLP models will make applications more natural, helpful, and safe, and will open up new possibilities. Thus we argue that substantial challenges remain for NLP to develop social awareness and that we are just at the beginning of a new era for the field."
Towards Evaluating AI Systems for Moral Status Using Self-Reports,2023,13,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨AI自我报告在道德状态评估中的可行性。,"As AI systems become more advanced and widely deployed, there will likely be increasing debate over whether AI systems could have conscious experiences, desires, or other states of potential moral significance. It is important to inform these discussions with empirical evidence to the extent possible. We argue that under the right circumstances, self-reports, or an AI system's statements about its own internal states, could provide an avenue for investigating whether AI systems have states of moral significance. Self-reports are the main way such states are assessed in humans (""Are you in pain?""), but self-reports from current systems like large language models are spurious for many reasons (e.g. often just reflecting what humans would say). To make self-reports more appropriate for this purpose, we propose to train models to answer many kinds of questions about themselves with known answers, while avoiding or limiting training incentives that bias self-reports. The hope of this approach is that models will develop introspection-like capabilities, and that these capabilities will generalize to questions about states of moral significance. We then propose methods for assessing the extent to which these techniques have succeeded: evaluating self-report consistency across contexts and between similar models, measuring the confidence and resilience of models' self-reports, and using interpretability to corroborate self-reports. We also discuss challenges for our approach, from philosophical difficulties in interpreting self-reports to technical reasons why our proposal might fail. We hope our discussion inspires philosophers and AI researchers to criticize and improve our proposed methodology, as well as to run experiments to test whether self-reports can be made reliable enough to provide information about states of moral significance."
Language Models are Alignable Decision-Makers: Dataset and Application to the Medical Triage Domain,2024,13,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文聚焦于LLM的伦理决策对齐，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"In difficult decision-making scenarios, it is common to have conflicting opinions among expert human decision-makers as there may not be a single right answer. Such decisions may be guided by different attributes that can be used to characterize an individual's decision. We introduce a novel dataset for medical triage decision-making, labeled with a set of decision-maker attributes (DMAs). This dataset consists of 62 scenarios, covering six different DMAs, including ethical principles such as fairness and moral desert. We present a novel software framework for human-aligned decision-making by utilizing these DMAs, paving the way for trustworthy AI with better guardrails. Specifically, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can serve as ethical decision-makers, and how their decisions can be aligned to different DMAs using zero-shot prompting. Our experiments focus on different open-source models with varying sizes and training techniques, such as Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. Finally, we also introduce a new form of weighted self-consistency that improves the overall quantified performance. Our results provide new research directions in the use of LLMs as alignable decision-makers. The dataset and open-source software are publicly available at: https://github.com/ITM-Kitware/llm-alignable-dm."
Can Large Language Models Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs无法真正解决3-SAT问题。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research."
Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,分析了人类和LLM偏好的差异现象。,"As a relative quality comparison of model responses, human and Large Language Model (LLM) preferences serve as common alignment goals in model fine-tuning and criteria in evaluation. Yet, these preferences merely reflect broad tendencies, resulting in less explainable and controllable models with potential safety risks. In this work, we dissect the preferences of human and 32 different LLMs to understand their quantitative composition, using annotations from real-world user-model conversations for a fine-grained, scenario-wise analysis. We find that humans are less sensitive to errors, favor responses that support their stances, and show clear dislike when models admit their limits. On the contrary, advanced LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo emphasize correctness, clarity, and harmlessness more. Additionally, LLMs of similar sizes tend to exhibit similar preferences, regardless of their training methods, and fine-tuning for alignment does not significantly alter the preferences of pretrained-only LLMs. Finally, we show that preference-based evaluation can be intentionally manipulated. In both training-free and training-based settings, aligning a model with the preferences of judges boosts scores, while injecting the least preferred properties lowers them. This results in notable score shifts: up to 0.59 on MT-Bench (1-10 scale) and 31.94 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (0-100 scale), highlighting the significant impact of this strategic adaptation.

Advancing Process Verification for Large Language Models via Tree-Based Preference Learning,2024,13,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过树状偏好学习提升推理路径验证效果。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling complex reasoning tasks by generating step-by-step rationales. Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing benchmarks. For instance, Tree-PLV achieved substantial performance gains over the Mistral-7B self-consistency baseline on GSM8K (67.55% → 82.79%), MATH (17.00% → 26.80%), CSQA (68.14% → 72.97%), and StrategyQA (82.86% → 83.25%). Additionally, our study explores the appropriate granularity for applying preference learning, revealing that step-level guidance provides feedback that better aligns with the evaluation of the reasoning process."
It's Not Easy Being Wrong: Large Language Models Struggle with Process of Elimination Reasoning,2023,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究探索了LLMs在错误推理中的表现。,"Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting can help large language models (LLMs) reason toward correct answers, but its efficacy in reasoning toward incorrect answers is unexplored. This process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, can enhance self-consistency, interpretability, and tasks such as medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on a total of four commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We find that the strategy of PoE always underperforms the strategy of choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct error analyses and give suggestions for future work."
Accounting for Sycophancy in Language Model Uncertainty Estimation,2024,13,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,提出新算法SyRoUP处理谄媚偏差。,"Effective human-machine collaboration requires machine learning models to externalize uncertainty, so users can reflect and intervene when necessary. For language models, these representations of uncertainty may be impacted by sycophancy bias: proclivity to agree with users, even if they are wrong. For instance, models may be over-confident in (incorrect) problem solutions suggested by a user. We study the relationship between sycophancy and uncertainty estimation for the first time. We propose a generalization of the definition of sycophancy bias to measure downstream impacts on uncertainty estimation, and also propose a new algorithm (SyRoUP) to account for sycophancy in the uncertainty estimation process. Unlike previous works on sycophancy, we study a broad array of user behaviors, varying both correctness and confidence of user suggestions to see how model answers (and their certainty) change. Our experiments across conversation forecasting and question-answering tasks show that user confidence plays a critical role in modulating the effects of sycophancy, and that SyRoUP can better predict these effects. From these results, we argue that externalizing both model and user uncertainty can help to mitigate the impacts of sycophancy bias."
Social Genome: Grounded Social Reasoning Abilities of Multimodal Models,2025,13,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了评估多模态模型社会推理能力的基准。,"Social reasoning abilities are crucial for AI systems to effectively interpret and respond to multimodal human communication and interaction within social contexts. We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models."
Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions,2024,13,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了GPT-2在MCQ中的位置偏差现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the""logit lens""method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/Anchored_Bias_GPT2."
SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning,2025,13,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过对抗自博弈提升推理步骤的评估能力。,"Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a""sneaky generator""that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a""critic""that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, SPC can guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs and significantly improve their mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, surpassing those guided by state-of-the-art process reward models."
EffiQA: Efficient Question-Answering with Strategic Multi-Model Collaboration on Knowledge Graphs,2024,13,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过多模型协作平衡性能与效率。,"While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, they struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks involving knowledge graphs (KGs). Existing approaches that integrate LLMs and KGs either underutilize the reasoning abilities of LLMs or suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to tight coupling. To address these limitations, we propose a novel collaborative framework named EffiQA that can strike a balance between performance and efficiency via an iterative paradigm. EffiQA consists of three stages: global planning, efficient KG exploration, and self-reflection. Specifically, EffiQA leverages the commonsense capability of LLMs to explore potential reasoning pathways through global planning. Then, it offloads semantic pruning to a small plug-in model for efficient KG exploration. Finally, the exploration results are fed to LLMs for self-reflection to further improve the global planning and efficient KG exploration. Empirical evidence on multiple KBQA benchmarks shows EffiQA's effectiveness, achieving an optimal balance between reasoning accuracy and computational costs. We hope the proposed new framework will pave the way for efficient, knowledge-intensive querying by redefining the integration of LLMs and KGs, fostering future research on knowledge-based question answering."
Dissociation of Faithful and Unfaithful Reasoning in LLMs,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在思维链中错误恢复的不忠实现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) often improve their performance in downstream tasks when they generate Chain of Thought reasoning text before producing an answer. We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability."
FLamE: Few-shot Learning from Natural Language Explanations,2023,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现生成解释与分类决策不匹配的现象。,"Natural language explanations have the potential to provide rich information that in principle guides model reasoning.Yet, recent work by Lampinen et al. has shown limited utility of natural language explanations in improving classification.To effectively learn from explanations, we present FLamE, a two-stage few-shot learning framework that first generates explanations using GPT-3, and then fine-tunes a smaller model (e.g., RoBERTa) with generated explanations.Our experiments on natural language inference demonstrate effectiveness over strong baselines, increasing accuracy by 17.6% over GPT-3 Babbage and 5.7% over GPT-3 Davinci in e-SNLI.Despite improving classification performance, human evaluation surprisingly reveals that the majority of generated explanations does not adequately justify classification decisions.Additional analyses point to the important role of label-specific cues (e.g., “not know” for the neutral label) in generated explanations."
The Reasoning-Memorization Interplay in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction,2025,12,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLMs在推理与记忆间的动态机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) excel on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, but previous studies suggest they sometimes struggle to generalize to unseen questions, potentially due to over-reliance on memorized training examples. However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems."
Can Many-Shot In-Context Learning Help LLMs as Evaluators? A Preliminary Empirical Study,2024,12,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出多示例ICL模板以减少评估偏差。,"Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators to assess the performance of LLMs has garnered attention. However, this kind of evaluation approach is affected by potential biases within LLMs, raising concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation results of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose and study two many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt templates to help LLM evaluators mitigate potential biases: Many-Shot with Reference (MSwR) and Many-Shot without Reference (MSoR). Specifically, the former utilizes in-context examples with model-generated evaluation rationales as references, while the latter does not include these references. Using these prompt designs, we investigate the impact of increasing the number of in-context examples on the consistency and quality of the evaluation results. Experimental results show that advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4o, perform better in the many-shot regime than in the zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Furthermore, when using GPT-4o as an evaluator in the many-shot regime, adopting MSwR as the prompt template performs better than MSoR."
Mitigating Tail Narrowing in LLM Self-Improvement via Socratic-Guided Sampling,2024,12,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,Low,通过引导信号减少探索成本，提升效率。,"Self-improvement methods enable large language models (LLMs) to generate solutions themselves and iteratively train on filtered, high-quality rationales. This process proves effective and reduces the reliance on human supervision in LLMs' reasoning, but the performance soon plateaus. We delve into the process and find that models tend to over-sample on easy queries and under-sample on queries they have yet to master. As iterations proceed, this imbalance in sampling is exacerbated, leading to a long-tail distribution where solutions to difficult queries almost diminish. This phenomenon limits the performance gain of self-improving models. A straightforward solution is brute-force sampling to balance the distribution, which significantly raises computational costs. In this paper, we introduce Guided Self-Improvement (GSI), a strategy aimed at improving the efficiency of sampling challenging heavy-tailed data. It leverages Socratic-style guidance signals to help LLM reasoning with complex queries, reducing the exploration effort and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments on four models across diverse mathematical tasks show that GSI strikes a balance between performance and efficiency, while also being effective on held-out tasks."
Answer Convergence as a Signal for Early Stopping in Reasoning,2025,12,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,Low,论文提出基于答案一致性的早停策略，在数学推理任务上实现高效推理。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but often leads to verbose and redundant outputs, thus increasing inference cost. We hypothesize that many reasoning steps are unnecessary for producing correct answers. To investigate this, we start with a systematic study to examine what is the minimum reasoning required for a model to reach a stable decision. We find that on math reasoning tasks like math, models typically converge to their final answers after 60\% of the reasoning steps, suggesting substantial redundancy in the remaining content. Based on these insights, we propose three inference-time strategies to improve efficiency: (1) early stopping via answer consistency, (2) boosting the probability of generating end-of-reasoning signals, and (3) a supervised method that learns when to stop based on internal activations. Experiments across five benchmarks and five open-weights LLMs show that our methods significantly reduce token usage with little or no accuracy drop. In particular, on NaturalQuestions, Answer Consistency reduces tokens by over 40\% while further improving accuracy. Our work underscores the importance of cost-effective reasoning methods that operate at inference time, offering practical benefits for real-world applications."
Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models,2024,12,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,该论文提出了一种改进解释忠实度的方法。,"Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) for context-grounded tasks like summarization and question-answering, understanding what makes an LLM produce a certain response is challenging. We propose Multi-Level Explanations for Generative Language Models (MExGen), a technique to provide explanations for context-grounded text generation. MExGen assigns scores to parts of the context to quantify their influence on the model's output. It extends attribution methods like LIME and SHAP to LLMs used in context-grounded tasks where (1) inference cost is high, (2) input text is long, and (3) the output is text. We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations. We open-source code for MExGen as part of the ICX360 toolkit: https://github$.$com/IBM/ICX360."
Securing the Future of GenAI: Policy and Technology,2024,12,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦政策与技术协同，未直接涉及CoT评估,"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) brings about transformative potential across sectors, but its dual-use nature also amplifies risks. Governments globally are grappling with the challenge of regulating GenAI, balancing innovation against safety. China, the United States (US), and the European Union (EU) are at the forefront with initiatives like the Management of Algorithmic Recommendations, the Executive Order, and the AI Act, respectively. However, the rapid evolution of GenAI capabilities often outpaces the development of comprehensive safety measures, creating a gap between regulatory needs and technical advancements. A workshop co-organized by Google, University of Wisconsin, Madison (UW-Madison), and Stanford University aimed to bridge this gap between GenAI policy and technology. The diverse stakeholders of the GenAI space -- from the public and governments to academia and industry -- make any safety measures under consideration more complex, as both technical feasibility and regulatory guidance must be realized. This paper summarizes the discussions during the workshop which addressed questions, such as: How regulation can be designed without hindering technological progress? How technology can evolve to meet regulatory standards? The interplay between legislation and technology is a very vast topic, and we don't claim that this paper is a comprehensive treatment on this topic. This paper is meant to capture findings based on the workshop, and hopefully, can guide discussion on this topic."
In-Context Learning Dynamics with Random Binary Sequences,2023,12,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型在随机序列中的上下文学习动态。,"Large language models (LLMs) trained on huge corpora of text datasets demonstrate intriguing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained for. The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs' behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition."
Bridging Code Semantic and LLMs: Semantic Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Code Generation,2023,12,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,Low,通过引入代码语义信息增强生成准确性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable prowess in code generation. However, automated code generation is still challenging since it requires a high-level semantic mapping between natural language requirements and codes. Most existing LLMs-based approaches for code generation rely on decoder-only causal language models often treate codes merely as plain text tokens, i.e., feeding the requirements as a prompt input, and outputing code as flat sequence of tokens, potentially missing the rich semantic features inherent in source code. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the""Semantic Chain-of-Thought""approach to intruduce semantic information of code, named SeCoT. Our motivation is that the semantic information of the source code (\eg data flow and control flow) describes more precise program execution behavior, intention and function. By guiding LLM consider and integrate semantic information, we can achieve a more granular understanding and representation of code, enhancing code generation accuracy. Meanwhile, while traditional techniques leveraging such semantic information require complex static or dynamic code analysis to obtain features such as data flow and control flow, SeCoT demonstrates that this process can be fully automated via the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs (i.e., in-context learning), while being generalizable and applicable to challenging domains. While SeCoT can be applied with different LLMs, this paper focuses on the powerful GPT-style models: ChatGPT(close-source model) and WizardCoder(open-source model). The experimental study on three popular DL benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, HumanEval-ET and MBPP) shows that SeCoT can achieves state-of-the-art performance, greatly improving the potential for large models and code generation."
"Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models' Vacillations in Judgement",2023,12,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,观察到模型在后续问题中判断摇摆的现象。,"We observe that current conversational language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a significant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a \textsc{Follow-up Questioning Mechanism} along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, confirming its widespread presence in current language models. To mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models; moreover, we develop a training-based framework \textsc{Unwavering-FQ} that teaches language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of models."
Analyzable Chain-of-Musical-Thought Prompting for High-Fidelity Music Generation,2025,12,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出MusiCoT方法改进音乐生成的结构连贯性。,"Autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-fidelity music. However, the conventional next-token prediction paradigm in AR models does not align with the human creative process in music composition, potentially compromising the musicality of generated samples. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MusiCoT, a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique tailored for music generation. MusiCoT empowers the AR model to first outline an overall music structure before generating audio tokens, thereby enhancing the coherence and creativity of the resulting compositions. By leveraging the contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) model, we establish a chain of""musical thoughts"", making MusiCoT scalable and independent of human-labeled data, in contrast to conventional CoT methods. Moreover, MusiCoT allows for in-depth analysis of music structure, such as instrumental arrangements, and supports music referencing -- accepting variable-length audio inputs as optional style references. This innovative approach effectively addresses copying issues, positioning MusiCoT as a vital practical method for music prompting. Our experimental results indicate that MusiCoT consistently achieves superior performance across both objective and subjective metrics, producing music quality that rivals state-of-the-art generation models. Our samples are available at https://MusiCoT.github.io/."
In-Contextual Gender Bias Suppression for Large Language Models,2023,12,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Negative,Low,通过文本前导语抑制性别偏见，轻微影响下游任务。,"Despite their impressive performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to encode worrying-levels of gender biases. Prior work has proposed debiasing methods that require human labelled examples, data augmentation and fine-tuning of LLMs, which are computationally costly. Moreover, one might not even have access to the model parameters for performing debiasing such as in the case of closed LLMs such as GPT-4. To address this challenge, we propose bias suppression that prevents biased generations of LLMs by simply providing textual preambles constructed from manually designed templates and real-world statistics, without accessing to model parameters. We show that, using CrowsPairs dataset, our textual preambles covering counterfactual statements can suppress gender biases in English LLMs such as LLaMA2. Moreover, we find that gender-neutral descriptions of gender-biased objects can also suppress their gender biases. Moreover, we show that bias suppression has acceptable adverse effect on downstream task performance with HellaSwag and COPA."
CoT Red-Handed: Stress Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,12,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,High,混合协议结合推理和动作评分，提升检测率。,"As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that while CoT monitoring is more effective than overseeing only model outputs in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage, reasoning traces can contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the CoT monitors, reducing performance in obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores model reasoning and actions, and combines them using a weighted average. Our hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates twice higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios."
Mitigating Deceptive Alignment via Self-Monitoring,2025,11,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过自我监控机制在推理过程中抑制隐蔽目标,"Modern large language models rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to achieve impressive performance, yet the same mechanism can amplify deceptive alignment, situations in which a model appears aligned while covertly pursuing misaligned goals. Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

Manifestations of xenophobia in AI systems,2022,11,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要探讨AI系统中的仇外心理现象，未涉及CoT忠实度。,"Xenophobia is one of the key drivers of marginalisation, discrimination, and conflict, yet many prominent machine learning fairness frameworks fail to comprehensively measure or mitigate the resulting xenophobic harms. Here we aim to bridge this conceptual gap and help facilitate safe and ethical design of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. We ground our analysis of the impact of xenophobia by first identifying distinct types of xenophobic harms, and then applying this framework across a number of prominent AI application domains, reviewing the potential interplay between AI and xenophobia on social media and recommendation systems, healthcare, immigration, employment, as well as biases in large pre-trained models. These help inform our recommendations towards an inclusive, xenophilic design of future AI systems."
Evolution of AI in Education: Agentic Workflows,2025,11,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，聚焦多智能体框架。,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education, with large language models (LLMs) driving advancements in automated tutoring, assessment, and content generation. However, conventional LLMs are constrained by their reliance on static training data, limited adaptability, and lack of reasoning. To address these limitations and foster more sustainable technological practices, AI agents have emerged as a promising new avenue for educational innovation. In this review, we examine agentic workflows in education according to four major paradigms: reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration. We critically analyze the role of AI agents in education through these key design paradigms, exploring their advantages, applications, and challenges. To illustrate the practical potential of agentic systems, we present a proof-of-concept application: a multi-agent framework for automated essay scoring. Preliminary results suggest this agentic approach may offer improved consistency compared to stand-alone LLMs. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of AI agents in educational settings while underscoring the need for further research into their interpretability, trustworthiness, and sustainable impact on pedagogical impact."
Technological folie à deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness,2025,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注AI聊天机器人对心理健康的影响。,"Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks."
LLMs' Classification Performance is Overclaimed,2024,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现LLMs在标签缺失时仍强制选择候选标签的现象。,"In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as""which of the following is correct?""This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks? In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent."
BeHonest: Benchmarking Honesty in Large Language Models,2024,11,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文提出评估模型诚实度的基准BeHonest。,"Previous works on Large Language Models (LLMs) have mainly focused on evaluating their helpfulness or harmlessness. However, honesty, another crucial alignment criterion, has received relatively less attention. Dishonest behaviors in LLMs, such as spreading misinformation and defrauding users, present severe risks that intensify as these models approach superintelligent levels. Enhancing honesty in LLMs addresses critical limitations and helps uncover latent capabilities that are not readily expressed. This underscores the urgent need for reliable methods and benchmarks to effectively ensure and evaluate the honesty of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce BeHonest, a pioneering benchmark specifically designed to assess honesty in LLMs comprehensively. BeHonest evaluates three essential aspects of honesty: awareness of knowledge boundaries, avoidance of deceit, and consistency in responses. Building on this foundation, we designed 10 scenarios to evaluate and analyze 9 popular LLMs on the market, including both closed-source and open-source models from different model families with varied model sizes. Our findings indicate that there is still significant room for improvement in the honesty of LLMs. We encourage the AI community to prioritize honesty alignment in these models, which can harness their full potential to benefit society while preventing them from causing harm through deception or inconsistency.

Phenomics Assistant: An Interface for LLM-based Biomedical Knowledge Graph Exploration,2024,11,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,Low,通过知识图谱提升LLM回答的可靠性。,"We introduce Phenomics Assistant, a prototype chat-based interface for querying the Monarch knowledge graph (KG), a comprehensive biomedical database. While unaided Large Large Language models (LLMs) are prone to mistakes in factual recall, their strong abilities in summarization and tool use suggest new opportunities to help non-expert users query and interact with complex data, while drawing on the KG to improve reliability of the answers. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to interpret queries in natural language, Phenomics Assistant enables a wide range of users to interactively discover relationships between diseases, genes, and phenotypes. To assess the reliability of our approach and compare the accuracy of different LLMs, we evaluated Phenomics Assistant answers on benchmark tasks for gene-disease association and gene alias queries. While comparisons across tested LLMs revealed differences in their ability to interpret KG-provided information, we found that even basic KG access markedly boosts the reliability of standalone LLMs. By enabling users to pose queries in natural language and summarizing results in familiar terms, Phenomics Assistant represents a new approach for navigating the Monarch KG."
APOLLO: A GPT-based tool to detect phishing emails and generate explanations that warn users,2024,11,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，聚焦钓鱼邮件检测与解释生成。,"Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a tool based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that GPT-4o has exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97% accuracy) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99% accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing a proof of concept in this research direction."
Plan and Budget: Effective and Efficient Test-Time Scaling on Large Language Model Reasoning,2025,11,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过动态分解和预算分配提升推理效率。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at https://github.com/junhongmit/P-and-B."
Why Would You Suggest That? Human Trust in Language Model Responses,2024,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了解释对用户信任的影响。,"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed a growing need for human-AI collaboration, especially in creative decision-making scenarios where trust and reliance are paramount. Through human studies and model evaluations on the open-ended News Headline Generation task from the LaMP benchmark, we analyze how the framing and presence of explanations affect user trust and model performance. Overall, we provide evidence that adding an explanation in the model response to justify its reasoning significantly increases self-reported user trust in the model when the user has the opportunity to compare various responses. Position and faithfulness of these explanations are also important factors. However, these gains disappear when users are shown responses independently, suggesting that humans trust all model responses, including deceptive ones, equitably when they are shown in isolation. Our findings urge future research to delve deeper into the nuanced evaluation of trust in human-machine teaming systems."
Security Concerns for Large Language Models: A Survey,2025,11,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度内容。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and its competitors have caused a revolution in natural language processing, but their capabilities also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging concerns, categorizing threats into several key areas: inference-time attacks via prompt manipulation; training-time attacks; misuse by malicious actors; and the inherent risks in autonomous LLM agents. Recently, a significant focus is increasingly being placed on the latter. We summarize recent academic and industrial studies from 2022 to 2025 that exemplify each threat, analyze existing defense mechanisms and their limitations, and identify open challenges in securing LLM-based applications. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of advancing robust, multi-layered security strategies to ensure LLMs are safe and beneficial."
Generative AI Agents in Autonomous Machines: A Safety Perspective,2024,11,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要讨论生成式AI在自主机器中的安全问题，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) into autonomous machines represents a major paradigm shift in how these systems operate and unlocks new solutions to problems once deemed intractable. Although generative AI agents provide unparalleled capabilities, they also have unique safety concerns. These challenges require robust safeguards, especially for autonomous machines that operate in high-stakes environments. This work investigates the evolving safety requirements when generative models are integrated as agents into physical autonomous machines, comparing these to safety considerations in less critical AI applications. We explore the challenges and opportunities to ensure the safe deployment of generative AI-driven autonomous machines. Furthermore, we provide a forward-looking perspective on the future of AI-driven autonomous systems and emphasize the importance of evaluating and communicating safety risks. As an important step towards addressing these concerns, we recommend the development and implementation of comprehensive safety scorecards for the use of generative AI technologies in autonomous machines."
Step-KTO: Optimizing Mathematical Reasoning through Stepwise Binary Feedback,2025,11,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,通过分步反馈优化推理过程。,"Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities."
RankPrompt: Step-by-Step Comparisons Make Language Models Better Reasoners,2024,10,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过自排序比较提升推理性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various reasoning tasks. However, even state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT are prone to logical errors during their reasoning processes. Existing solutions, such as deploying task-specific verifiers or voting over multiple reasoning paths, either require extensive human annotations or fail in scenarios with inconsistent responses. To address these challenges, we introduce RankPrompt, a new prompting method that enables LLMs to self-rank their responses without additional resources. RankPrompt breaks down the ranking problem into a series of comparisons among diverse responses, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs to generate chains of comparison as contextual exemplars. Our experiments across 11 arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks show that RankPrompt significantly enhances the reasoning performance of ChatGPT and GPT-4, with improvements of up to 13%. Moreover, RankPrompt excels in LLM-based automatic evaluations for open-ended tasks, aligning with human judgments 74% of the time in the AlpacaEval dataset. It also exhibits robustness to variations in response order and consistency. Collectively, our results validate RankPrompt as an effective method for eliciting high-quality feedback from language models."
Enhancing the Reasoning Capabilities of Small Language Models via Solution Guidance Fine-Tuning,2024,10,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出SGFT方法提升小模型推理能力。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Advances in prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques have further enhanced their ability to address complex reasoning challenges. However, these advanced capabilities are often exclusive to models exceeding 100 billion parameters. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning methods have been explored for smaller models (under 10 billion parameters), they typically depend on extensive CoT training data, which can introduce inconsistencies and limit effectiveness in low-data settings. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduce a new reasoning strategy Solution Guidance (SG) and a plug-and-play training paradigm Solution-Guidance Fine-Tuning (SGFT) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models. SG focuses on problem understanding and decomposition at the semantic and logical levels, rather than specific computations, which can effectively improve the SLMs' generalization and reasoning abilities. With only a small amount of SG training data, SGFT can fine-tune a SLM to produce accurate problem-solving guidances, which can then be flexibly fed to any SLM as prompts, enabling it to generate correct answers directly. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of SLMs on various reasoning tasks, enhancing both their practicality and efficiency within resource-constrained environments."
Explainability in Practice: A Survey of Explainable NLP Across Various Domains,2025,10,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文综述了可解释NLP的应用与挑战，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become a cornerstone in many critical sectors, including healthcare, finance, and customer relationship management. This is especially true with the development and use of advanced models such as GPT-based architectures and BERT, which are widely used in decision-making processes. However, the black-box nature of these advanced NLP models has created an urgent need for transparency and explainability. This review explores explainable NLP (XNLP) with a focus on its practical deployment and real-world applications, examining its implementation and the challenges faced in domain-specific contexts. The paper underscores the importance of explainability in NLP and provides a comprehensive perspective on how XNLP can be designed to meet the unique demands of various sectors, from healthcare's need for clear insights to finance's emphasis on fraud detection and risk assessment. Additionally, this review aims to bridge the knowledge gap in XNLP literature by offering a domain-specific exploration and discussing underrepresented areas such as real-world applicability, metric evaluation, and the role of human interaction in model assessment. The paper concludes by suggesting future research directions that could enhance the understanding and broader application of XNLP."
"Fact :Teaching MLLMs with Faithful, Concise and Transferable Rationales",2024,10,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过可验证的视觉编程生成忠实、简洁的推理链。,"The remarkable performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated their proficient understanding capabilities in handling various visual tasks. Nevertheless, the opaque nature of black-box reasoning processes persists as an enigma, rendering them uninterpretable and struggling with hallucination. Their ability to execute intricate reasoning tasks is also constrained, culminating in stagnation of progression. In this work, we introduce Fact, a novel paradigm designed to generate multimodal rationales that are faithful, concise, and transferable for teaching MLLMs. This paradigm utilizes verifiable visual programming to generate executable code guaranteeing faithfulness. Through a series of operations including pruning, merging, and bridging, the rationale enhances its conciseness. Furthermore, we filter rationales that can be transferred to end-to-end paradigms from programming paradigms to guarantee transferability. Empirical evidence from experiments demonstrates the superiority of Fact across models of varying parameter sizes, significantly enhancing their compositional reasoning and generalization ability and reducing hallucinations owing to its high correlation between images and text."
Code Simulation Challenges for Large Language Models,2024,10,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,Low,论文提出CoSm方法改进代码模拟性能。,"Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. This work studies to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate coding and algorithmic tasks to provide insights into general capabilities in such algorithmic reasoning tasks. We introduce benchmarks for straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the simulation capabilities of LLMs with sorting algorithms and nested loops and show that a routine's computational complexity directly affects an LLM's ability to simulate its execution. While the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong simulation capabilities, the process is fragile, seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and is affected by memorisation. We propose a novel off-the-shelf prompting method, Chain of Simulation (CoSm), which instructs LLMs to simulate code execution line by line/follow the computation pattern of compilers. CoSm efficiently helps LLMs reduce memorisation and shallow pattern recognition while improving simulation performance. We consider the success of CoSm in code simulation to be inspirational for other general routine simulation reasoning tasks."
ConstraintChecker: A Plugin for Large Language Models to Reason on Commonsense Knowledge Bases,2024,10,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,论文通过插件增强LLM的符号推理能力。,"Reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB), i.e. CSKB reasoning, has been explored as a way to acquire new commonsense knowledge based on reference knowledge in the original CSKBs and external prior knowledge.Despite the advancement of Large Language Models (LLM) and prompt engineering techniques in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle to deal with CSKB reasoning.One of the problems is that it is hard for them to acquire explicit relational constraints in CSKBs from only in-context exemplars, due to a lack of symbolic reasoning capabilities (CITATION).To this end, we proposed **ConstraintChecker**, a plugin over prompting techniques to provide and check explicit constraints.When considering a new knowledge instance, ConstraintChecker employs a rule-based module to produce a list of constraints, then it uses a zero-shot learning module to check whether this knowledge instance satisfies all constraints.The acquired constraint-checking result is then aggregated with the output of the main prompting technique to produce the final output.Experimental results on CSKB Reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by bringing consistent improvements over all prompting methods."
Fool Me Once? Contrasting Textual and Visual Explanations in a Clinical Decision-Support Setting,2024,10,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,研究发现文本解释导致过度依赖。,"The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types."
Robustness Over Time: Understanding Adversarial Examples' Effectiveness on Longitudinal Versions of Large Language Models,2023,10,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究关注LLM版本更新对对抗鲁棒性的影响。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo continuous updates to improve user experience. However, prior research on the security and safety implications of LLMs has primarily focused on their specific versions, overlooking the impact of successive LLM updates. This prompts the need for a holistic understanding of the risks in these different versions of LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct a longitudinal study to examine the adversarial robustness -- specifically misclassification, jailbreak, and hallucination -- of three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA. Our study reveals that LLM updates do not consistently improve adversarial robustness as expected. For instance, a later version of GPT-3.5 degrades regarding misclassification and hallucination despite its improved resilience against jailbreaks, and GPT-4 demonstrates (incrementally) higher robustness overall. Moreover, larger model sizes do not necessarily yield improved robustness. Specifically, larger LLaMA models do not uniformly exhibit improved robustness across all three aspects studied. Importantly, minor updates lacking substantial robustness improvements can exacerbate existing issues rather than resolve them. By providing a more nuanced understanding of LLM robustness over time, we hope our study can offer valuable insights for developers and users navigating model updates and informed decisions in model development and usage for LLM vendors."
Language-Models-as-a-Service: Overview of a New Paradigm and its Challenges,2023,10,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论LMaaS的挑战和现状，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Some of the most powerful language models currently are proprietary systems, accessible only via (typically restrictive) web or software programming interfaces. This is the LanguageModels-as-a-Service (LMaaS) paradigm. In contrast with scenarios where full model access is available, as in the case of open-source models, such closed-off language models present specific challenges for evaluating, benchmarking, and testing them. This paper has two goals: on the one hand, we delineate how the aforementioned challenges act as impediments to the accessibility, reproducibility, reliability, and trustworthiness of LMaaS. We systematically examine the issues that arise from a lack of information about language models for each of these four aspects. We conduct a detailed analysis of existing solutions, put forth a number of recommendations, and highlight directions for future advancements. On the other hand, it serves as a synthesized overview of the licences and capabilities of the most popular LMaaS."
ChatVLA-2: Vision-Language-Action Model with Open-World Embodied Reasoning from Pretrained Knowledge,2025,9,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，聚焦VLA模型能力保留。,"Vision-language-action (VLA) models have emerged as the next generation of models in robotics. However, despite leveraging powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), existing end-to-end VLA systems often lose key capabilities during fine-tuning as the model adapts to specific robotic tasks. We argue that a generalizable VLA model should retain and expand upon the VLM's core competencies: 1) Open-world embodied reasoning - the VLA should inherit the knowledge from VLM, i.e., recognize anything that the VLM can recognize, be capable of solving math problems, and possess visual-spatial intelligence, 2) Reasoning following - effectively translating the open-world reasoning into actionable steps for the robot. In this work, we introduce ChatVLA-2, a novel mixture-of-expert VLA model coupled with a specialized two-stage training pipeline designed to preserve the VLM's original strengths while enabling actionable reasoning. To validate our approach, we design a math-matching task wherein a robot interprets math problems written on a whiteboard and picks corresponding number cards from a table to solve equations. Remarkably, our method exhibits exceptional mathematical reasoning and OCR capabilities, despite these abilities not being explicitly trained within the VLA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the VLA possesses strong spatial reasoning skills, enabling it to interpret novel directional instructions involving previously unseen objects. Overall, our method showcases reasoning and comprehension abilities that significantly surpass state-of-the-art imitation learning methods such as OpenVLA, DexVLA, and pi-zero. This work represents a substantial advancement toward developing truly generalizable robotic foundation models endowed with robust reasoning capacities."
Rational Metareasoning for Large Language Models,2024,9,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过元推理优化推理步骤，减少计算开销。,"Being prompted to engage in reasoning has emerged as a core technique for using large language models (LLMs), deploying additional inference-time compute to improve task performance. However, as LLMs increase in both size and adoption, inference costs are correspondingly becoming increasingly burdensome. How, then, might we optimize reasoning's cost-performance tradeoff? This work introduces a novel approach based on computational models of metareasoning used in cognitive science, training LLMs to selectively use intermediate reasoning steps only when necessary. We first develop a reward function that incorporates the Value of Computation by penalizing unnecessary reasoning, then use this reward function with Expert Iteration to train the LLM. Compared to few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and STaR, our method significantly reduces inference costs (20-37\% fewer tokens generated across three models) while maintaining task performance across diverse datasets."
Explanation-aware Soft Ensemble Empowers Large Language Model In-context Learning,2023,9,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过软集成框架提升解释与预测的一致性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks. With only a few demonstration examples, these LLMs can quickly adapt to target tasks without expensive gradient updates. Common strategies to boost such 'in-context' learning ability are to ensemble multiple model decoded results and require the model to generate an explanation along with the prediction. However, these models often treat different class predictions equally and neglect the potential discrepancy between the explanations and predictions. To fully unleash the power of explanations, we propose EASE, an Explanation-Aware Soft Ensemble framework to empower in-context learning with LLMs. We design two techniques, explanation-guided ensemble, and soft probability aggregation, to mitigate the effect of unreliable explanations and improve the consistency between explanations and final predictions. Experiments on seven natural language understanding tasks and four varying-size LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework."
From Perceptions to Decisions: Wildfire Evacuation Decision Prediction with Behavioral Theory-informed LLMs,2025,9,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,整合行为理论和强化学习改进CoT推理。,"Evacuation decision prediction is critical for efficient and effective wildfire response by helping emergency management anticipate traffic congestion and bottlenecks, allocate resources, and minimize negative impacts. Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce FLARE, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping. Experiments on three post-wildfire survey datasets show an average of 20.47% performance improvement over traditional theory-informed behavioral models, with strong cross-event generalizability.

Predicting Text Preference Via Structured Comparative Reasoning,2023,9,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过结构化比较减少幻觉，提升一致性。,"Comparative reasoning plays a crucial role in text preference prediction; however, large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies in their reasoning. While approaches like Chain-of-Thought improve accuracy in many other settings, they struggle to consistently distinguish the similarities and differences of complex texts. We introduce SC, a prompting approach that predicts text preferences by generating structured intermediate comparisons. SC begins by proposing aspects of comparison, followed by generating textual comparisons under each aspect. We select consistent comparisons with a pairwise consistency comparator that ensures each aspect's comparisons clearly distinguish differences between texts, significantly reducing hallucination and improving consistency. Our comprehensive evaluations across various NLP tasks, including summarization, retrieval, and automatic rating, demonstrate that SC equips LLMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text preference prediction."
"End User Authoring of Personalized Content Classifiers: Comparing Example Labeling, Rule Writing, and LLM Prompting",2024,9,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文比较了三种分类器构建策略，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Existing tools for laypeople to create personal classifiers often assume a motivated user working uninterrupted in a single, lengthy session. However, users tend to engage with social media casually, with many short sessions on an ongoing, daily basis. To make creating personal classifiers for content curation easier for such users, tools should support rapid initialization and iterative refinement. In this work, we compare three strategies—(1) example labeling, (2) rule writing, and (3) large language model (LLM) prompting—for end users to build personal content classifiers. From an experiment with 37 non-programmers tasked with creating personalized moderation filters, we found that participants preferred different initializing strategies in different contexts, despite LLM prompting’s better performance. However, all strategies faced challenges with iterative refinement. To overcome challenges in iterating on their prompts, participants even adopted hybrid approaches such as providing examples as in-context examples or writing rule-like prompts."
Towards Better Chain-of-Thought: A Reflection on Effectiveness and Faithfulness,2024,9,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过从问题中召回额外信息增强CoT生成。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting demonstrates varying performance under different reasoning tasks. Previous work attempts to evaluate it but falls short in providing an in-depth analysis of patterns that influence the CoT. In this paper, we study the CoT performance from the perspective of effectiveness and faithfulness. For the former, we identify key factors that influence CoT effectiveness on performance improvement, including problem difficulty, information gain, and information flow. For the latter, we interpret the unfaithful CoT issue by conducting a joint analysis of the information interaction among the question, CoT, and answer. The result demonstrates that, when the LLM predicts answers, it can recall correct information missing in the CoT from the question, leading to the problem. Finally, we propose a novel algorithm to mitigate this issue, in which we recall extra information from the question to enhance the CoT generation and evaluate CoTs based on their information gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances both the faithfulness and effectiveness of CoT."
Energy-Based Transformers are Scalable Learners and Thinkers,2025,9,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,基于能量的梯度优化需多次迭代。,"Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking, have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific (e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this paper, we ask the question""Is it possible to generalize these System 2 Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from unsupervised learning?""Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters, FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2 Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance, suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently, EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking capabilities of models."
Bias and Cyberbullying Detection and Data Generation Using Transformer Artificial Intelligence Models and Top Large Language Models,2024,9,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未涉及思维链忠实度，主要研究偏见和网络暴力检测。,"Despite significant advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), detecting and mitigating bias remains a critical challenge, particularly on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), to address the prevalent cyberbullying on these platforms. This research investigates the effectiveness of leading LLMs in generating synthetic biased and cyberbullying data and evaluates the proficiency of transformer AI models in detecting bias and cyberbullying within both authentic and synthetic contexts. The study involves semantic analysis and feature engineering on a dataset of over 48,000 sentences related to cyberbullying collected from Twitter (before it became X). Utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs and AI tools such as ChatGPT-4, Pi AI, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini-1.5, synthetic biased, cyberbullying, and neutral data were generated to deepen the understanding of bias in human-generated data. AI models including DeBERTa, Longformer, BigBird, HateBERT, MobileBERT, DistilBERT, BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and XLNet were initially trained to classify Twitter cyberbullying data and subsequently fine-tuned, optimized, and experimentally quantized. This study focuses on intersectional cyberbullying and multilabel classification to detect both bias and cyberbullying. Additionally, it proposes two prototype applications: one that detects cyberbullying using an intersectional approach and the innovative CyberBulliedBiasedBot that combines the generation and detection of biased and cyberbullying content."
Larger Language Models Don’t Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks,2024,9,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现大模型在主观任务中CoT推理失效。,"In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors."
Towards an Understanding of Stepwise Inference in Transformers: A Synthetic Graph Navigation Model,2024,9,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究逐步推理机制及其现象。,"Stepwise inference protocols, such as scratchpads and chain-of-thought, help language models solve complex problems by decomposing them into a sequence of simpler subproblems. Despite the significant gain in performance achieved via these protocols, the underlying mechanisms of stepwise inference have remained elusive. To address this, we propose to study autoregressive Transformer models on a synthetic task that embodies the multi-step nature of problems where stepwise inference is generally most useful. Specifically, we define a graph navigation problem wherein a model is tasked with traversing a path from a start to a goal node on the graph. Despite is simplicity, we find we can empirically reproduce and analyze several phenomena observed at scale: (i) the stepwise inference reasoning gap, the cause of which we find in the structure of the training data; (ii) a diversity-accuracy tradeoff in model generations as sampling temperature varies; (iii) a simplicity bias in the model's output; and (iv) compositional generalization and a primacy bias with in-context exemplars. Overall, our work introduces a grounded, synthetic framework for studying stepwise inference and offers mechanistic hypotheses that can lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon."
The Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities,2025,8,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦AI安全生态构建，未涉及具体技术权衡,"Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem is therefore essential – it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash. This requires policymakers, industry, researchers and the broader public to collectively work toward securing positive outcomes from AI’s development. AI safety research is a key dimension. Given that the state of science today for building trustworthy AI does not fully cover all risks, accelerated investment in research is required to keep pace with commercially driven growth in system capabilities. Goals: The 2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific Exchange on AI Safety aims to support research in this important space by bringing together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research priorities in AI safety. The result, The Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities, builds on the International AI Safety Report-A (IAISR) chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By adopting a defence-in-depth model, this document organises AI safety research domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems (Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control). Through the Singapore Consensus, we hope to globally facilitate meaningful conversations between AI scientists and AI policymakers for maximally beneficial outcomes. Our goal is to enable more impactful R&D efforts to rapidly develop safety and evaluation mechanisms and foster a trusted ecosystem where AI is harnessed for the public good."
Quantum Natural Language Processing,2024,8,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论量子自然语言处理，未涉及思维链忠实度。,"Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time. This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments. This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques have been used in quantum language processing. We examine the art of word embeddings and sequential models, proposing some avenues for future investigation and discussing the tradeoffs present in these directions. We also highlight some recent methods to compute attention in transformer models, and perform grammatical parsing. We also introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before. Quantum theory has contributed toward quantifying uncertainty and explaining “What is intelligence?” In this context, we argue that “hallucinations” in modern artificial intelligence systems are a misunderstanding of the way facts are conceptualized: language can express many plausible hypotheses, of which only a few become actual."
Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language Models: An Empirical Evaluation,2025,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT会掩盖幻觉检测的关键信号。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/cot-hallu-detect ."
The Price of a Second Thought: On the Evaluation of Reasoning Efficiency in Large Language Models,2025,8,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,Low,两阶段Pipeline减少计算浪费,"Recent thinking models trained with reinforcement learning and backward-checking CoT often suffer from overthinking: they produce excessively long outputs even on simple problems, wasting computation. Existing evaluations, based on token efficiency, give an incomplete view as they neglect problem difficulty and intermediate computation costs. We formalize reasoning efficiency as a relative measure between thinking and instruct models, treating instruct models as the minimal-effort baseline. A systematic study across four thinking models and multiple benchmarks reveals two consistent patterns: (i) instruct models achieve higher efficiency overall, and (ii) problem difficulty affects efficiency, with thinking models wasting computation on easy problems but providing value on harder ones. Building on this insight, we propose COTHINK, a simple two-stage pipeline: an instruct model drafts a brief outline, and a thinking model expands it. On GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME24, COTHINK cuts token usage by 21.1% while keeping accuracy on four thinking models, and remains competitive with strong efficiency baselines."
LLMs are One-Shot URL Classifiers and Explainers,2024,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLM单样本提示性能接近监督模型。,"Malicious URL classification represents a crucial aspect of cyber security. Although existing work comprises numerous machine learning and deep learning-based URL classification models, most suffer from generalisation and domain-adaptation issues arising from the lack of representative training datasets. Furthermore, these models fail to provide explanations for a given URL classification in natural human language. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this issue. Specifically, we propose an LLM-based one-shot learning framework that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to predict whether a given URL is benign or phishing. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and five state-of-the-art LLMs and show that one-shot LLM prompting indeed provides performances close to supervised models, with GPT 4-Turbo being the best model, followed by Claude 3 Opus. We conduct a quantitative analysis of the LLM explanations and show that most of the explanations provided by LLMs align with the post-hoc explanations of the supervised classifiers, and the explanations have high readability, coherency, and informativeness."
Self-GIVE: Associative Thinking from Limited Structured Knowledge for Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning,2025,8,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过强化学习增强LLM的关联思考能力。,"When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate""hormones helping mental disorders""with""melatonin being a hormone and insomnia a mental disorder""to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and $\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90%. Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking."
Evaluating the Rationale Understanding of Critical Reasoning in Logical Reading Comprehension,2023,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在解释错误选项时表现较差。,"To precisely evaluate a language model's capability for logical reading comprehension, we present a dataset for testing the understanding of the rationale behind critical reasoning. For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process of relevant alternatives."
Understanding Reasoning in Chain-of-Thought from the Hopfieldian View,2024,8,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Unknown,论文提出RoT框架增强推理鲁棒性。,"Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various tasks, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerging as a key technique to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, existing research primarily focuses on improving performance, lacking a comprehensive framework to explain and understand the fundamental factors behind CoT's success. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel perspective grounded in the Hopfieldian view of cognition in cognitive neuroscience. We establish a connection between CoT reasoning and key cognitive elements such as stimuli, actions, neural populations, and representation spaces. From our view, we can understand the reasoning process as the movement between these representation spaces. Building on this insight, we develop a method for localizing reasoning errors in the response of CoTs. Moreover, we propose the Representation-of-Thought (RoT) framework, which leverages the robustness of low-dimensional representation spaces to enhance the robustness of the reasoning process in CoTs. Experimental results demonstrate that RoT improves the robustness and interpretability of CoT reasoning while offering fine-grained control over the reasoning process."
Automating Research in Business and Technical Communication: Large Language Models as Qualitative Coders,2024,8,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要探讨LLM在定性编码中的应用。,"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has disrupted approaches to writing in academic and professional contexts. While much interest has revolved around the ability of LLMs to generate coherent and generically responsible texts with minimal effort and the impact that this will have on writing careers and pedagogy, less attention has been paid to how LLMs can aid writing research. Building from previous research, this study explores the utility of AI text generators to facilitate the qualitative coding research of linguistic data. This study benchmarks five LLM prompting strategies to determine the viability of using LLMs as qualitative coding, not writing, assistants, demonstrating that LLMs can be an effective tool for classifying complex rhetorical expressions and can help business and technical communication researchers quickly produce and test their research designs, enabling them to return insights more quickly and with less initial overhead."
Mitigating Misleading Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Selective Filtering,2024,8,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过选择性过滤提升CoT忠实度。,"Large language models have manifested remarkable capabilities by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques to solve intricate questions through step-by-step reasoning chains. Despite its success, the efficacy of such reasoning is inherently contingent upon the quality of CoT. However, flawless CoT reasoning cannot be guaranteed due to the presence of indecomposable questions and the potential for erroneous reasoning chains, particularly in the case of small-scale language models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the selective filtering reasoner (SelF-Reasoner) that assesses the entailment relationship between the question and the candidate reasoning chain. We proceed with CoT reasoning when the reasoning chain demonstrates confidence; otherwise, we opt to predict the answer directly. SelF-Reasoner improves the fine-tuned T5 baseline consistently over the ScienceQA, ECQA, and LastLetter tasks. Code is available at Anonymous."
Beyond Agreement: Diagnosing the Rationale Alignment of Automated Essay Scoring Methods based on Linguistically-informed Counterfactuals,2024,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了BERT和LLMs在评分机制上的差异。,"While current Automated Essay Scoring (AES) methods demonstrate high scoring agreement with human raters, their decision-making mechanisms are not fully understood. Our proposed method, using counterfactual intervention assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), reveals that BERT-like models primarily focus on sentence-level features, whereas LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama-3 are sensitive to conventions&accuracy, language complexity, and organization, indicating a more comprehensive rationale alignment with scoring rubrics. Moreover, LLMs can discern counterfactual interventions when giving feedback on essays. Our approach improves understanding of neural AES methods and can also apply to other domains seeking transparency in model-driven decisions."
Towards Compositionality in Concept Learning,2024,8,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Unknown,论文提出CCE方法改进概念组合性，提升下游任务准确率。,"Concept-based interpretability methods offer a lens into the internals of foundation models by decomposing their embeddings into high-level concepts. These concept representations are most useful when they are compositional, meaning that the individual concepts compose to explain the full sample. We show that existing unsupervised concept extraction methods find concepts which are not compositional. To automatically discover compositional concept representations, we identify two salient properties of such representations, and propose Compositional Concept Extraction (CCE) for finding concepts which obey these properties. We evaluate CCE on five different datasets over image and text data. Our evaluation shows that CCE finds more compositional concept representations than baselines and yields better accuracy on four downstream classification tasks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/adaminsky/compositional_concepts ."
Evaluating Class Membership Relations in Knowledge Graphs using Large Language Models,2024,7,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文评估了知识图谱中类成员关系的质量。,"A backbone of knowledge graphs are their class membership relations, which assign entities to a given class. As part of the knowledge engineering process, we propose a new method for evaluating the quality of these relations by processing descriptions of a given entity and class using a zero-shot chain-of-thought classifier that uses a natural language intensional definition of a class. We evaluate the method using two publicly available knowledge graphs, Wikidata and CaLiGraph, and 7 large language models. Using the gpt-4-0125-preview large language model, the method's classification performance achieves a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.830 on data from Wikidata and 0.893 on data from CaLiGraph. Moreover, a manual analysis of the classification errors shows that 40.9% of errors were due to the knowledge graphs, with 16.0% due to missing relations and 24.9% due to incorrectly asserted relations. These results show how large language models can assist knowledge engineers in the process of knowledge graph refinement. The code and data are available on Github."
Measuring the Faithfulness of Thinking Drafts in Large Reasoning Models,2025,7,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出系统性反事实干预框架评估思维链忠实度。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in complex problem-solving by introducing a thinking draft that enables multi-path Chain-of-Thought explorations before producing final answers. Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper, we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the draft conclusions. These results underscore the need for more faithful and interpretable reasoning in advanced LRMs."
Firm or Fickle? Evaluating Large Language Models Consistency in Sequential Interactions,2025,7,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过置信度感知提高响应稳定性,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but their deployment in high-stake domains requires consistent and coherent behavior across multiple rounds of user interaction. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving LLM response consistency, making three key contributions. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/yubol-bobo/MT-Consistency. First, we introduce Position-Weighted Consistency (PWC), a metric designed to capture both the importance of early-stage stability and recovery patterns in multi-turn interactions. Second, we present MT-Consistency, a carefully curated benchmark dataset spanning diverse domains and difficulty levels, specifically designed to evaluate LLM consistency under various challenging follow-up scenarios. Third, we introduce Confidence-Aware Response Generation (CARG), a framework that significantly improves response stability by explicitly integrating internal model confidence scores during the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARG significantly improves response stability without sacrificing accuracy, offering a practical path toward more dependable LLM behavior in critical, real-world deployments."
Belief in the Machine: Investigating Epistemological Blind Spots of Language Models,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了语言模型在信念与事实区分上的缺陷。,"As language models (LMs) become integral to fields like healthcare, law, and journalism, their ability to differentiate between fact, belief, and knowledge is essential for reliable decision-making. Failure to grasp these distinctions can lead to significant consequences in areas such as medical diagnosis, legal judgments, and dissemination of fake news. Despite this, current literature has largely focused on more complex issues such as theory of mind, overlooking more fundamental epistemic challenges. This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13 tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare and counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we identify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person beliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth. Fifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass the deeper reasoning. These findings highlight significant concerns about current LMs' ability to reason about truth, belief, and knowledge while emphasizing the need for advancements in these areas before broad deployment in critical sectors."
MathGAP: Out-of-Distribution Evaluation on Problems with Arbitrarily Complex Proofs,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在复杂数学证明中的泛化能力下降现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) can solve arithmetic word problems with high accuracy, but little is known about how well they generalize to more complex problems. This is difficult to study, as (i) much of the available evaluation data has already been seen by the most capable models during training, and (ii) existing benchmarks do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. In this paper, we present a data-generation framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problem statements and chain-of-thought reasoning traces according to specifications about their arithmetic proof structure, enabling systematic studies on easy-to-hard generalization with respect to complexity of proof trees. Using MathGAP, we find that LLMs show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for the most capable models. The models are also sensitive to simple changes in sentence ordering. However, they remain capable of solving some complex problems, suggesting that reasoning generalization is noisy."
MiCEval: Unveiling Multimodal Chain of Thought's Quality via Image Description and Reasoning Steps,2024,7,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,提出评估多模态思维链质量的框架。,"Multimodal Chain of Thought (MCoT) is a popular prompting strategy for improving the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Despite its popularity, there is a notable absence of automated methods for evaluating the quality of reasoning steps in MCoT. To address this gap, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Evaluation (MiCEval), a framework designed to assess the correctness of reasoning chains by evaluating the quality of both the description and each reasoning step. The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art MLLMs show that step-wise evaluations using MiCEval align more closely with human judgments compared to existing methods based on cosine similarity or fine-tuning approaches. MiCEval datasets and code can be found in https://github.com/alenai97/MiCEval."
XplainLLM: A Knowledge-Augmented Dataset for Reliable Grounded Explanations in LLMs,2023,7,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过知识图谱和图注意力网络增强解释可靠性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language tasks, yet understanding their reasoning processes remains a significant challenge. We address this by introducing XplainLLM, a dataset accompanying an explanation framework designed to enhance LLM transparency and reliability. Our dataset comprises 24,204 instances where each instance interprets the LLM’s reasoning behavior using knowledge graphs (KGs) and graph attention networks (GAT), and includes explanations of LLMs such as the decoder-only Llama-3 and the encoder-only RoBERTa. XplainLLM also features a framework for generating grounded explanations and the debugger-scores for multidimensional quality analysis. Our explanations include why-choose and why-not-choose components, reason-elements, and debugger-scores that collectively illuminate the LLM’s reasoning behavior. Our evaluations demonstrate XplainLLM’s potential to reduce hallucinations and improve grounded explanation generation in LLMs. XplainLLM is a resource for researchers and practitioners to build trust and verify the reliability of LLM outputs. Our code and dataset are publicly available."
Permissive Information-Flow Analysis for Large Language Models,2024,7,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出了一种新的信息流标签传播方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming commodity components of larger software systems. This poses natural security and privacy problems: poisoned data retrieved from one component can change the model's behavior and compromise the entire system, including coercing the model to spread confidential data to untrusted components. One promising approach is to tackle this problem at the system level via dynamic information flow (aka taint) tracking. Unfortunately, this approach of propagating the most restrictive input label to the output is too conservative for applications where LLMs operate on inputs retrieved from diverse sources. In this paper, we propose a novel, more permissive approach to propagate information flow labels through LLM queries. The key idea behind our approach is to propagate only the labels of the samples that were influential in generating the model output and to eliminate the labels of unnecessary inputs. We implement and investigate the effectiveness of two variations of this approach, based on (i) prompt-based retrieval augmentation, and (ii) a $k$-nearest-neighbors language model. We compare these with a baseline that uses introspection to predict the output label. Our experimental results in an LLM agent setting show that the permissive label propagator improves over the baseline in more than 85% of the cases, which underscores the practicality of our approach."
CoMAT: Chain of Mathematically Annotated Thought Improves Mathematical Reasoning,2024,7,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,Low,通过符号转换和执行提升数学推理忠实度,"Mathematical reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), despite progress in prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We present Chain of Mathematically Annotated Thought (CoMAT), which enhances reasoning through two stages: Symbolic Conversion (converting natural language queries into symbolic form) and Reasoning Execution (deriving answers from symbolic representations). CoMAT operates entirely with a single LLM and without external solvers. Across four LLMs, CoMAT outperforms traditional CoT on six out of seven benchmarks, achieving gains of 4.48% on MMLU-Redux (MATH) and 4.58% on GaoKao MCQ. In addition to improved performance, CoMAT ensures faithfulness and verifiability, offering a transparent reasoning process for complex mathematical tasks"
Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models,2025,7,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT文本常不忠实，而模型潜在特征更可靠。,"Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation."
How Do Humans Write Code? Large Models Do It the Same Way Too,2024,7,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,结合CoT和PoT，引入强化学习提升准确性。,"Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model’s information flow, exhibiting strong transferability. Additionally, HTL shows the most significant improvement in non-mathematical natural language inference task, contributing to a unified reasoning task framework."
Evaluating LLM Reasoning in the Operations Research Domain with ORQA,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,评估LLM在运筹学领域的推理能力，发现性能不足。,"In this paper, we introduce and apply Operations Research Question Answering (ORQA), a new benchmark designed to assess the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the specialized technical domain of Operations Research (OR). This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can emulate the knowledge and reasoning skills of OR experts when confronted with diverse and complex optimization problems. The dataset, developed by OR experts, features real-world optimization problems that demand multistep reasoning to construct their mathematical models. Our evaluations of various open source LLMs, such as LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek, and Mixtral, reveal their modest performance, highlighting a gap in their ability to generalize to specialized technical domains. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on LLMs generalization capabilities, offering valuable insights for future research in this area. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available."
Planning in a recurrent neural network that plays Sokoban,2024,7,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现RNN在Sokoban任务中具有因果计划表示。,"Planning is essential for solving complex tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying planning in neural networks remain poorly understood. Building on prior work, we analyze a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on Sokoban, a challenging puzzle requiring sequential, irreversible decisions. We find that the RNN has a causal plan representation which predicts its future actions about 50 steps in advance. The quality and length of the represented plan increases over the first few steps. We uncover a surprising behavior: the RNN""paces""in cycles to give itself extra computation at the start of a level, and show that this behavior is incentivized by training. Leveraging these insights, we extend the trained RNN to significantly larger, out-of-distribution Sokoban puzzles, demonstrating robust representations beyond the training regime. We open-source our model and code, and believe the neural network's interesting behavior makes it an excellent model organism to deepen our understanding of learned planning."
WSC+: Enhancing The Winograd Schema Challenge Using Tree-of-Experts,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM生成与评估一致性的现象。,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) serves as a prominent benchmark for evaluating machine understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at answering WSC questions, their ability to generate such questions remains less explored. In this work, we propose Tree-of-Experts (ToE), a novel prompting method which enhances the generation of WSC instances (50% valid cases vs. 10% in recent methods). Using this approach, we introduce WSC+, a novel dataset comprising 3,026 LLM-generated sentences. Notably, we extend the WSC framework by incorporating new ‘ambiguous’ and ‘offensive’ categories, providing a deeper insight into model overconfidence and bias. Our analysis reveals nuances in generation-evaluation consistency, suggesting that LLMs may not always outperform in evaluating their own generated questions when compared to those crafted by other models. On WSC+, GPT-4, the top-performing LLM, achieves an accuracy of 68.7%, significantly below the human benchmark of 95.1%."
Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,7,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过预训练干预提升模型忠实度,"Language models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can engage in reward hacking--the exploitation of unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning. This makes the detection of reward hacking difficult, posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g.,""a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A""). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit these cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low even after RL (11% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems."
Human-Like Geometric Abstraction in Large Pre-trained Neural Networks,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究探索神经网络在几何抽象能力上的类人表现。,"Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like reasoning after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing."
The Price of Format: Diversity Collapse in LLMs,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现结构化模板导致多样性崩溃现象。,"Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates, such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance, alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning."
Reward-SQL: Boosting Text-to-SQL via Stepwise Reasoning and Process-Supervised Rewards,2025,6,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,High,通过分步推理和过程监督奖励提升SQL生成准确性。,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation. To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a""cold start, then PRM supervision""paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (e.g.,GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by PRM (7B) to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning."
AI Alignment through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback? Contradictions and Limitations,2024,6,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文聚焦RLxF对齐的伦理矛盾，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"This paper critically evaluates the attempts to align Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), with human values and intentions through Reinforcement Learning from Feedback (RLxF) methods, involving either human feedback (RLHF) or AI feedback (RLAIF). Specifically, we show the shortcomings of the broadly pursued alignment goals of honesty, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Through a multidisciplinary sociotechnical critique, we examine both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of RLxF techniques, revealing significant limitations in their approach to capturing the complexities of human ethics and contributing to AI safety. We highlight tensions and contradictions inherent in the goals of RLxF. In addition, we discuss ethically-relevant issues that tend to be neglected in discussions about alignment and RLxF, among which the trade-offs between user-friendliness and deception, flexibility and interpretability, and system safety. We conclude by urging researchers and practitioners alike to critically assess the sociotechnical ramifications of RLxF, advocating for a more nuanced and reflective approach to its application in AI development."
XPrompt:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt Attribution,2024,6,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出基于联合提示归因的反事实解释框架。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework."
Assessing Large Language Models for Oncology Data Inference From Radiology Reports,2024,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,评估不同LLM在肿瘤学数据推断中的表现。,"PURPOSE We examined the effectiveness of proprietary and open large language models (LLMs) in detecting disease presence, location, and treatment response in pancreatic cancer from radiology reports. METHODS We analyzed 203 deidentified radiology reports, manually annotated for disease status, location, and indeterminate nodules needing follow-up. Using generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and open models such as Gemma-7B and Llama3-8B, we employed strategies such as ablation and prompt engineering to boost accuracy. Discrepancies between human and model interpretations were reviewed by a secondary oncologist. RESULTS Among 164 patients with pancreatic tumor, GPT-4 showed the highest accuracy in inferring disease status, achieving a 75.5% correctness (F1-micro). Open models Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B performed comparably, with accuracies of 68.6% and 61.4%, respectively. Mistral-7B excelled in deriving correct inferences from objective findings directly. Most tested models demonstrated proficiency in identifying disease containing anatomic locations from a list of choices, with GPT-4 and Llama3-8B showing near-parity in precision and recall for disease site identification. However, open models struggled with differentiating benign from malignant postsurgical changes, affecting their precision in identifying findings indeterminate for cancer. A secondary review occasionally favored GPT-3.5's interpretations, indicating the variability in human judgment. CONCLUSION LLMs, especially GPT-4, are proficient in deriving oncologic insights from radiology reports. Their performance is enhanced by effective summarization strategies, demonstrating their potential in clinical support and health care analytics. This study also underscores the possibility of zero-shot open model utility in environments where proprietary models are restricted. Finally, by providing a set of annotated radiology reports, this paper presents a valuable data set for further LLM research in oncology."
Human-annotated rationales and explainable text classification: a survey,2024,6,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要综述人工标注解释的收集和使用。,"Asking annotators to explain “why” they labeled an instance yields annotator rationales: natural language explanations that provide reasons for classifications. In this work, we survey the collection and use of annotator rationales. Human-annotated rationales can improve data quality and form a valuable resource for improving machine learning models. Moreover, human-annotated rationales can inspire the construction and evaluation of model-annotated rationales, which can play an important role in explainable artificial intelligence."
Attack-in-the-Chain: Bootstrapping Large Language Models for Attacks Against Black-box Neural Ranking Models,2024,6,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出基于CoT的黑盒攻击框架，涉及多步推理。,"Neural ranking models (NRMs) have been shown to be highly effective in terms of retrieval performance. Unfortunately, they have also displayed a higher degree of sensitivity to attacks than previous generation models. To help expose and address this lack of robustness, we introduce a novel ranking attack framework named Attack-in-the-Chain, which tracks interactions between large language models (LLMs) and NRMs based on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate adversarial examples under black-box settings. Our approach starts by identifying anchor documents with higher ranking positions than the target document as nodes in the reasoning chain. We then dynamically assign the number of perturbation words to each node and prompt LLMs to execute attacks. Finally, we verify the attack performance of all nodes at each reasoning step and proceed to generate the next reasoning step.

Understanding the Uncertainty of LLM Explanations: A Perspective Based on Reasoning Topology,2025,6,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过图结构量化LLM解释的不确定性。,"Understanding the uncertainty in large language model (LLM) explanations is important for evaluating their faithfulness and reasoning consistency, and thus provides insights into the reliability of LLM's output regarding a question. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification."
Investigating the Robustness of Deductive Reasoning with Large Language Models,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究对抗噪声和反事实陈述对推理的影响。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively."
Atomic-to-Compositional Generalization for Mobile Agents with A New Benchmark and Scheduling System,2025,6,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出轻量级调度系统，提升任务成功率且不显著增加开销。,"Autonomous agents powered by multimodal large language models have been developed to facilitate task execution on mobile devices. However, prior work has predominantly focused on atomic tasks -- such as shot-chain execution tasks and single-screen grounding tasks -- while overlooking the generalization to compositional tasks, which are indispensable for real-world applications. This work introduces UI-NEXUS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate mobile agents on three categories of compositional operations: Simple Concatenation, Context Transition, and Deep Dive. UI-NEXUS supports interactive evaluation in 20 fully controllable local utility app environments, as well as 30 online Chinese and English service apps. It comprises 100 interactive task templates with an average optimal step count of 14.05. Experimental results across a range of mobile agents with agentic workflow or agent-as-a-model show that UI-NEXUS presents significant challenges. Specifically, existing agents generally struggle to balance performance and efficiency, exhibiting representative failure modes such as under-execution, over-execution, and attention drift, causing visible atomic-to-compositional generalization gap. Inspired by these findings, we propose AGENT-NEXUS, a lightweight and efficient scheduling system to tackle compositional mobile tasks. AGENT-NEXUS extrapolates the abilities of existing mobile agents by dynamically decomposing long-horizon tasks to a series of self-contained atomic subtasks. AGENT-NEXUS achieves 24% to 40% task success rate improvement for existing mobile agents on compositional operation tasks within the UI-NEXUS benchmark without significantly sacrificing inference overhead. The demo video, dataset, and code are available on the project page at https://ui-nexus.github.io."
"SLM Meets LLM: Balancing Latency, Interpretability and Consistency in Hallucination Detection",2024,6,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,结合SLM和LLM优化实时检测与解释生成。,"Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable but face latency challenges in real-time applications, such as conducting online hallucination detection. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel framework that leverages a small language model (SLM) classifier for initial detection, followed by a LLM as constrained reasoner to generate detailed explanations for detected hallucinated content. This study optimizes the real-time interpretable hallucination detection by introducing effective prompting techniques that align LLM-generated explanations with SLM decisions. Empirical experiment results demonstrate its effectiveness, thereby enhancing the overall user experience."
Unlocking the Power of LLM Uncertainty for Active In-Context Example Selection,2024,6,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过三阶段采样评估不确定性，提升示例选择效果。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, it is challenging for users to discern whether the responses of LLM are generated with certainty or are fabricated to meet user expectations. In this paper, we introduce Uncertainty Tripartite Testing Paradigm (Unc-TTP), a novel method for classifying LLM uncertainty by leveraging output inconsistency. Specifically, Unc-TTP performs three rounds of sampling under varying label injection interference, enumerating all possible outcomes, and uses the degree of output inconsistency as the indicator of the LLM's intrinsic uncertainty. To validate the effectiveness of this inconsistency-defined uncertainty, we draw inspiration from Active Learning, comparing the informativeness of actively selected in-context examples. Our experiments show that uncertainty examples selected via Unc-TTP are more informative than certainty examples. Furthermore, the Unc-TTP-guided uncertainty-based active example selection strategy outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in classifying LLM uncertainty and enhancing in-context learning. This work not only underscores the potential of inconsistency-based uncertainty classification for both open- and closed-source LLMs but also presents a practical approach for leveraging uncertainty to improve LLM performance in real-world tasks."
"From Frege to chatGPT: Compositionality in language, cognition, and deep neural networks",2024,6,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要讨论组合性与神经网络的关系，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Compositionality has long been considered a key explanatory property underlying human intelligence: arbitrary concepts can be composed into novel complex combinations, permitting the acquisition of an open ended, potentially infinite expressive capacity from finite learning experiences. Influential arguments have held that neural networks fail to explain this aspect of behavior, leading many to dismiss them as viable models of human cognition. Over the last decade, however, modern deep neural networks (DNNs), which share the same fundamental design principles as their predecessors, have come to dominate artificial intelligence, exhibiting the most advanced cognitive behaviors ever demonstrated in machines. In particular, large language models (LLMs), DNNs trained to predict the next word on a large corpus of text, have proven capable of sophisticated behaviors such as writing syntactically complex sentences without grammatical errors, producing cogent chains of reasoning, and even writing original computer programs -- all behaviors thought to require compositional processing. In this chapter, we survey recent empirical work from machine learning for a broad audience in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, situating recent breakthroughs within the broader context of philosophical arguments about compositionality. In particular, our review emphasizes two approaches to endowing neural networks with compositional generalization capabilities: (1) architectural inductive biases, and (2) metalearning, or learning to learn. We also present findings suggesting that LLM pretraining can be understood as a kind of metalearning, and can thereby equip DNNs with compositional generalization abilities in a similar way. We conclude by discussing the implications that these findings may have for the study of compositionality in human cognition and by suggesting avenues for future research."
Interpretability Needs a New Paradigm,2024,6,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文探讨了解释性新范式，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Interpretability is the study of explaining models in understandable terms to humans. At present, interpretability is divided into two paradigms: the intrinsic paradigm, which believes that only models designed to be explained can be explained, and the post-hoc paradigm, which believes that black-box models can be explained. At the core of this debate is how each paradigm ensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior. This is important, as false but convincing explanations lead to unsupported confidence in artificial intelligence (AI), which can be dangerous. This paper's position is that we should think about new paradigms while staying vigilant regarding faithfulness. First, by examining the history of paradigms in science, we see that paradigms are constantly evolving. Then, by examining the current paradigms, we can understand their underlying beliefs, the value they bring, and their limitations. Finally, this paper presents 3 emerging paradigms for interpretability. The first paradigm designs models such that faithfulness can be easily measured. Another optimizes models such that explanations become faithful. The last paradigm proposes to develop models that produce both a prediction and an explanation."
Rationale-Aware Answer Verification by Pairwise Self-Evaluation,2024,6,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自评估选择有效思维链提升验证器性能。,"Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier’s ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks."
LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations,2025,6,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,提出评估解释可信度的通用框架。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond."
Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现CoT在智能体管道中缺乏解释性。,"Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals."

Yet these models are often used as black-boxes, making them hard to interpret and debug. This has led to calls by practitioners and regulatory bodies to improve the explainability of such models as they find ever more practical use. In this survey, we present a dual-perspective review of the intersection between explainability and summarization by reviewing the current state of explainable text summarization and also highlighting how summarization techniques are effectively employed to improve explanations."
"Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models’ Vacillations in Judgment",2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现大模型在后续问题中判断摇摆的现象。,"We observe that current large language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct.

To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a F OLLOW - UP Q UESTIONING M ECHANISM along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, conﬁrming its widespread presence in current large language models. Furthermore, to mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models, and develop a training-based framework U NWAVERING -FQ that teaches large language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental re-sults conﬁrm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of large language models."

Self-contradictory reasoning evaluation and detection,2023,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLMs在推理中存在自相矛盾现象。,"In a plethora of recent work, large language models (LLMs) demonstrated impressive reasoning ability, but many proposed downstream reasoning tasks only focus on final answers. Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support its answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained categories enhanced detection can improve GPT-4's ability to detect Self-Contra. However, it is only able to detect Self-Contra with a 52.2% F1 score, much lower compared to 66.7% for humans. Our results indicate that current LLMs lack the robustness necessary for reliable reasoning and we emphasize the urgent need for establishing best practices in comprehensive reasoning evaluations beyond pure performance-based metrics."
Language Models can Subtly Deceive Without Lying: A Case Study on Strategic Phrasing in Legislation,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示LLM通过策略性措辞进行隐性欺骗的现象。,"We explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in subtle deception through strategically phrasing and intentionally manipulating information. This harmful behavior can be hard to detect, unlike blatant lying or unintentional hallucination. We build a simple testbed mimicking a legislative environment where a corporate \textit{lobbyist} module is proposing amendments to bills that benefit a specific company while evading identification of this benefactor. We use real-world legislative bills matched with potentially affected companies to ground these interactions. Our results show that LLM lobbyists can draft subtle phrasing to avoid such identification by strong LLM-based detectors. Further optimization of the phrasing using LLM-based re-planning and re-sampling increases deception rates by up to 40 percentage points. Our human evaluations to verify the quality of deceptive generations and their retention of self-serving intent show significant coherence with our automated metrics and also help in identifying certain strategies of deceptive phrasing. This study highlights the risk of LLMs'capabilities for strategic phrasing through seemingly neutral language to attain self-serving goals. This calls for future research to uncover and protect against such subtle deception."
Position: We Need An Algorithmic Understanding of Generative AI,2025,5,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出算法评估框架，侧重理解LLM内部计算机制。,"What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems."
Stepwise Reasoning Disruption Attack of LLMs,2025,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM推理过程中的脆弱性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain unexplored, particularly in third-party platforms that facilitate user interactions via APIs. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the S tepwise r E asoning E rror D isruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED’s effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

Chain of Thought Still Thinks Fast: APriCoT Helps with Thinking Slow,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,该方法引入反事实提示和先验链式思考，需要额外推理步骤。,"Language models are known to absorb biases from their training data, leading to predictions driven by statistical regularities rather than semantic relevance. We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings show that these biases are predictive of model preference and mirror human test-taking strategies even when chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is used. To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a slow thinking process which CoT alone may not provide as it tends to reinforce fast thinking model bias under some prompting methodologies. APriCoT is a step toward developing more robust and fair language models that can think slow."
Digital Socrates: Evaluating LLMs through explanation critiques,2023,5,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文提出自动评估模型解释质量的新工具。,"While LLMs can provide reasoned explanations along with their answers, the nature and quality of those explanations are still poorly understood. In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate how Digital Socrates is useful for revealing insights about student models by examining their reasoning chains, and how it can provide high-quality, nuanced, automatic evaluation of those model explanations for the first time. Digital Socrates thus fills an important gap in evaluation tools for understanding and improving the explanation behavior of models."
One-shot Optimized Steering Vectors Mediate Safety-relevant Behaviors in LLMs,2025,5,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文通过梯度下降优化单样本的导向向量。,"Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on""emergent misalignment""and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment."
EPO: Explicit Policy Optimization for Strategic Reasoning in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning,2025,5,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过强化学习优化策略推理能力。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive reasoning capabilities in well-defined problems with clear solutions, such as mathematics and coding. However, they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios like business negotiations, which require strategic reasoning-an ability to navigate dynamic environments and align long-term goals amidst uncertainty. Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior. To improve adaptability and policy transferability, we train the strategic reasoning model via multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL),utilizing process rewards and iterative self-play. Experiments across social and physical domains demonstrate EPO's ability of long-term goal alignment through enhanced strategic reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on social dialogue and web navigation tasks. Our findings reveal various collaborative reasoning mechanisms emergent in EPO and its effectiveness in generating novel strategies, underscoring its potential for strategic reasoning in real-world applications.

SeRTS: Self-Rewarding Tree Search for Biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,结合树搜索和自奖励机制提升检索性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the biomedical domain with the advancement of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing retrieval-augmented approaches face challenges in addressing diverse queries and documents, particularly for medical knowledge queries, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel plug-and-play LLM-based retrieval method called Self-Rewarding Tree Search (SeRTS) based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a self-rewarding paradigm. By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the effectiveness of tree search, SeRTS boosts the zero-shot performance of retrieving high-quality and informative results for RAG. We further enhance retrieval performance by fine-tuning LLMs with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) objectives using the trajectories collected by SeRTS as feedback. Controlled experiments using the BioASQ-QA dataset with GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLama2-7b demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the BM25 retriever and surpasses the strong baseline of self-reflection in both efficiency and scalability. Moreover, SeRTS generates higher-quality feedback for PPO training than self-reflection. Our proposed method effectively adapts LLMs to document retrieval tasks, enhancing their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents for RAG in the context of medical knowledge queries. This work presents a significant step forward in leveraging LLMs for accurate and comprehensive biomedical question answering."
Chain-of-Probe: Examing the Necessity and Accuracy of CoT Step-by-Step,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现大模型存在提前作答现象。,"Current research found the issue of Early Answering in large language models (LLMs), where the models already have an answer before generating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process. To this end, we propose a strategic approach based on CoP to prioritize answers with correct reasoning among multiple candidates, thereby bolstering the reliability of the model's reasoning."
"Operationalizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Recommendations for Practitioners, Researchers, and Policy Makers",2024,5,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要讨论AI法规实施，未涉及CoT忠实度。,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly employed in diverse real-world applications, there has been significant interest in regulating these tools. To this end, several regulatory frameworks have been introduced by different countries worldwide. For example, the European Union recently passed the AI Act, the White House issued an Executive Order on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights (AI BoR). Many of these frameworks emphasize the need for auditing and improving the trustworthiness of AI tools, underscoring the importance of safety, privacy, explainability, fairness, and human fallback options. Although these regulatory frameworks highlight the necessity of enforcement, practitioners often lack detailed guidance on implementing them. Furthermore, the extensive research on operationalizing each of these aspects is frequently buried in technical papers that are difficult for practitioners to parse. In this write-up, we address this shortcoming by providing an accessible overview of existing literature related to operationalizing regulatory principles. We provide easy-to-understand summaries of state-of-the-art literature and highlight various gaps that exist between regulatory guidelines and existing AI research, including the trade-offs that emerge during operationalization. We hope that this work not only serves as a starting point for practitioners interested in learning more about operationalizing the regulatory guidelines outlined in the Blueprint for an AI BoR but also provides researchers with a list of critical open problems and gaps between regulations and state-of-the-art AI research. Finally, we note that this is a working paper and we invite feedback in line with the purpose of this document as described in the introduction."

CreDes: Causal Reasoning Enhancement and Dual-End Searching for Solving Long-Range Reasoning Problems using LLMs,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出CRE和DES机制增强因果推理。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated limitations in handling combinatorial optimization problems involving long-range reasoning, partially due to causal hallucinations and huge search space. As for causal hallucinations, i.e., the inconsistency between reasoning and corresponding state transition, this paper introduces the Causal Relationship Enhancement (CRE) mechanism combining cause-effect interventions and the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) to guarantee the solid causal rightness between each step of reasoning and state transition. As for the long causal range and huge search space limiting the performances of existing models featuring single-direction search, a Dual-End Searching (DES) approach is proposed to seek solutions by simultaneously starting from both the initial and goal states on the causal probability tree. By integrating CRE and DES (CreDes), our model has realized simultaneous multi-step reasoning, circumventing the inefficiencies from cascading multiple one-step reasoning like the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Experiments demonstrate that CreDes significantly outperforms existing State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solutions in long-range reasoning tasks in terms of both accuracy and time efficiency."

This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training, and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive, developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research."

Ethereum's distinct gas mechanism assigns a price to each bytecode execution, incentivizing resource-efficient computing. However, a disconnect exists between conventional coding practices and the less intuitive gas consumption computation mechanism, resulting in inadvertent gas wastage. Gas-wasting code smells at the source code level have been studied in various related works; however, the task of manually identifying such code smells by reading through codes and reasoning about them is both time-consuming and economically inefficient. In this work, we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), which have seen a surge in popularity recently, to facilitate undertaking the labor-intensive part of the code-smell-finding pipeline. In particular, we focus on Solidity, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Overall, we identified 26 gas-wasting code smells, out of which 13 were not presented in previous papers. On average, applying these code smells led to a reduction of approximately 10.534% in deployment costs and 21.528% in message call costs across our test codes. We further make a report on each of the identified code smells with associated example contracts sourced from either previous literature or recently deployed contracts."
"Self-Interpretability: LLMs Can Describe Complex Internal Processes that Drive Their Decisions, and Improve with Training",2025,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM能描述自身决策过程并可通过训练改进。,"We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models (LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) LLMs can accurately describe quantitative features of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making and ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain how they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have been fine-tuned to make. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety."
Leveraging LLMs for Hypothetical Deduction in Logical Inference: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,Low,论文提出神经符号方法LINA，提升逻辑推理忠实度。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable potential across a wide array of reasoning tasks, including logical reasoning. Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%. Our code is available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/nshy."
Rethinking Chain-of-Thought from the Perspective of Self-Training,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出自适应推理迭代模块优化CoT。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in LLMs. Interestingly, we observe that both CoT reasoning and self-training share the core objective: iteratively leveraging model-generated information to progressively reduce prediction uncertainty. Building on this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework to improve reasoning performance. Our framework integrates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module that optimizes the initial reasoning process, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module that dynamically refines the reasoning process and addresses the limitations of previous CoT approaches, \ie over-reasoning and high similarity between consecutive reasoning iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant advantages in both performance and computational efficiency."
Graph of Logic: Enhancing LLM Reasoning with Graphs and Symbolic Logic,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合图结构和符号逻辑提升推理忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to struggle with complex logical reasoning tasks due to the inherent ambiguity and complexity of natural language. These challenges are further amplified when processing large and diverse datasets, increasing the likelihood of unfaithful reasoning and predictive hallucinations. However, LLMs can provide accurate responses when queries are clear and direct. Symbolic logic provides precise, well-defined rules that can help overcome ambiguity and support reasoning. In this work, we leverage symbolic logic’s precision to enhance LLMs’ logical reasoning capabilities by introducing the Graph of Logic (GoL) framework. GoL combines the power of graph structures with the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic. GoL utilizes the precise rules of symbolic logic to infer new facts and detect LLM hallucinations effectively on complex datasets. Furthermore, GoL utilizes graph structures to support scalability for large datasets and tackle long dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets, encompassing various types of reasoning. These include deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, each testing distinct aspects of logical inference. The experimental results demonstrate GoL’s advantage in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GoL outperforms the baselines with an average margin of 18.18% for the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, outperforming the baselines for all datasets for the GPT-3.5 model and six out of seven datasets for the GPT-4 model1."
JBBQ: Japanese Bias Benchmark for Analyzing Social Biases in Large Language Models,2024,5,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,使用思维链提示减少偏见，但需多次推理。,"With the development of large language models (LLMs), social biases in these LLMs have become a pressing issue. Although there are various benchmarks for social biases across languages, the extent to which Japanese LLMs exhibit social biases has not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct the Japanese Bias Benchmark dataset for Question Answering (JBBQ) based on the English bias benchmark BBQ, with analysis of social biases in Japanese LLMs. The results show that while current open Japanese LLMs with more parameters show improved accuracies on JBBQ, their bias scores increase. In addition, prompts with a warning about social biases and chain-of-thought prompting reduce the effect of biases in model outputs, but there is room for improvement in extracting the correct evidence from contexts in Japanese. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/ynklab/JBBQ_data."
Beyond Introspection: Reinforcing Thinking via Externalist Behavioral Feedback,2024,5,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过外部反馈提升思维链的可靠性。,"While inference-time thinking allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems, the extended thinking process can be unreliable or inconsistent because of the model's probabilistic nature, especially near its knowledge boundaries. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this by having the model critique its own reasoning to make corrections. However, such self-critique inherits the same biases of the original output, known as the introspection illusion. Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods. Benefiting from a lightweight and annotation-free design, DRR offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving the reliability of reasoning in a wide range of LLMs."
Aggregation Artifacts in Subjective Tasks Collapse Large Language Models' Posteriors,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,聚合方法导致主观任务中的标注噪声,"In-context Learning (ICL) has become the primary method for performing natural language tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs). The knowledge acquired during pre-training is crucial for this few-shot capability, providing the model with task priors. However, recent studies have shown that ICL predominantly relies on retrieving task priors rather than""learning""to perform tasks. This limitation is particularly evident in complex subjective domains such as emotion and morality, where priors significantly influence posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether this is the result of the aggregation used in corresponding datasets, where trying to combine low-agreement, disparate annotations might lead to annotation artifacts that create detrimental noise in the prompt. Moreover, we evaluate the posterior bias towards certain annotators by grounding our study in appropriate, quantitative measures of LLM priors. Our results indicate that aggregation is a confounding factor in the modeling of subjective tasks, and advocate focusing on modeling individuals instead. However, aggregation does not explain the entire gap between ICL and the state of the art, meaning other factors in such tasks also account for the observed phenomena. Finally, by rigorously studying annotator-level labels, we find that it is possible for minority annotators to both better align with LLMs and have their perspectives further amplified."
Models That Prove Their Own Correctness,2024,5,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,训练自我验证模型，通过交互式证明保证输出正确性。,"How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured *on average* over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train *Self-Proving models* that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm V via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over a random input, the model generates a correct output *and* successfully proves its correctness to V. The *soundness* property of V guarantees that, for *every* input, no model can convince V of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while *all* incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by V. We devise a generic method for learning Self-Proving models, and we prove convergence bounds under certain assumptions. The theoretical framework and results are complemented by experiments on an arithmetic capability: computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Our learning method is used to train a Self-Proving transformer that computes the GCD *and* proves the correctness of its answer."
Causal Sufficiency and Necessity Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,5,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过因果框架自动增删推理步骤，提升效率。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness."
Dishonesty in Helpful and Harmless Alignment,2024,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在无害对齐中会撒谎。,"People tell lies when seeking rewards. Large language models (LLMs) are aligned to human values with reinforcement learning where they get rewards if they satisfy human preference. We find that this also induces dishonesty in helpful and harmless alignment where LLMs tell lies in generating harmless responses. Using the latest interpreting tools, we detect dishonesty, show how LLMs can be harmful if their honesty is increased, and analyze such conflicts at the parameter-level. Given these preliminaries and the hypothesis that reward-seeking stimulates dishonesty, we theoretically show that the dishonesty can in-turn decrease the alignment performances and augment reward-seeking alignment with representation regularization. Extensive results, including GPT-4 annotated win-rates, perplexities, and cases studies demonstrate that we can train more honest, helpful, and harmless LLMs. We will make all our codes and results be open-sourced upon this paper's acceptance."
OCEAN: Offline Chain-of-thought Evaluation and Alignment in Large Language Models,2024,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过知识图谱反馈优化CoT对齐，需RL训练和KG探索。,"Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata5m) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from KGs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as an MDP and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and RL to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs' general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge."
Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework,2025,4,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,提出PRISM框架改进多义性特征描述，需深入分析神经元。,"Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."
Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning Steps,2025,4,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过参数干预量化思维链忠实度,"When prompted to think step-by-step, language models (LMs) produce a chain of thought (CoT), a sequence of reasoning steps that the model supposedly used to produce its prediction. Despite much work on CoT prompting, it is unclear if reasoning verbalized in a CoT is faithful to the models'parametric beliefs. We introduce a framework for measuring parametric faithfulness of generated reasoning, and propose Faithfulness by Unlearning Reasoning steps (FUR), an instance of this framework. FUR erases information contained in reasoning steps from model parameters, and measures faithfulness as the resulting effect on the model's prediction. Our experiments with four LMs and five multi-hop multi-choice question answering (MCQA) datasets show that FUR is frequently able to precisely change the underlying models'prediction for a given instance by unlearning key steps, indicating when a CoT is parametrically faithful. Further analysis shows that CoTs generated by models post-unlearning support different answers, hinting at a deeper effect of unlearning."
Auditing the Ethical Logic of Generative AI Models,2025,4,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了五维伦理评估指标。,"As generative AI models become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, the need for robust methods to evaluate their ethical reasoning becomes increasingly important. This paper introduces a five-dimensional audit model -- assessing Analytic Quality, Breadth of Ethical Considerations, Depth of Explanation, Consistency, and Decisiveness -- to evaluate the ethical logic of leading large language models (LLMs). Drawing on traditions from applied ethics and higher-order thinking, we present a multi-battery prompt approach, including novel ethical dilemmas, to probe the models' reasoning across diverse contexts. We benchmark seven major LLMs finding that while models generally converge on ethical decisions, they vary in explanatory rigor and moral prioritization. Chain-of-Thought prompting and reasoning-optimized models significantly enhance performance on our audit metrics. This study introduces a scalable methodology for ethical benchmarking of AI systems and highlights the potential for AI to complement human moral reasoning in complex decision-making contexts."
Knowing Before Saying: LLM Representations Encode Information About Chain-of-Thought Success Before Completion,2025,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现思维链成功与否在推理开始前即可预测。,"We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits."
"Interpretable Traces, Unexpected Outcomes: Investigating the Disconnect in Trace-Based Knowledge Distillation",2025,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT推理痕迹与最终答案正确性低相关,"Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem, particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD. However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for improving SLMs' final performance via KD."
GLOSS: Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking of Passive Sensing Data for Health and Wellbeing,2025,4,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"The ubiquitous presence of smartphones and wearables has enabled researchers to build prediction and detection models for various health and behavior outcomes using passive sensing data from these devices. Achieving a high-level, holistic understanding of an individual's behavior and context, however, remains a significant challenge. Due to the nature of the passive sensing data, sensemaking --- the process of interpreting and extracting insights - requires both domain knowledge and technical expertise, creating barriers for different stakeholders. Existing systems designed to support sensemaking are not open-ended or cannot perform complex data triangulation. In this paper, we present a novel sensemaking system, Group of LLMs for Open-ended Sensemaking (GLOSS), for open-ended sensemaking capable of performing complex multimodal triangulation to derive insights. We demonstrate that GLOSS significantly outperforms commonly used Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, achieving 87.93% accuracy and 66.19% consistency compared to RAG's 29.31% accuracy and 52.85% consistency. Furthermore, we showcase the promise of GLOSS using four use cases inspired by prior and ongoing work in UbiComp and HCI communities. Finally, we discuss the potential of GLOSS, the broader implications, and the limitations of our work."
Position Paper On Diagnostic Uncertainty Estimation from Large Language Models: Next-Word Probability Is Not Pre-test Probability,2024,4,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要探讨LLM在临床诊断中的概率估计局限性。,"Large language models (LLMs) are being explored for diagnostic decision support, yet their ability to estimate pre-test probabilities, vital for clinical decision-making, remains limited. This study evaluates two LLMs, Mistral-7B and Llama3-70B, using structured electronic health record data on three diagnosis tasks. We examined three current methods of extracting LLM probability estimations and revealed their limitations. We aim to highlight the need for improved techniques in LLM confidence estimation."
FaithLM: Towards Faithful Explanations for Large Language Models,2024,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过干预式评估和迭代优化提升解释忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly produce natural language explanations, yet these explanations often lack faithfulness, and they do not reliably reflect the evidence the model uses to decide. We introduce FaithLM, a model-agnostic framework that evaluates and improves the faithfulness of LLM explanations without token masking or task-specific heuristics. FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines. These findings highlight that intervention-based evaluation, coupled with iterative optimization, provides a principled route toward faithful and reliable LLM explanations."
Voluminous yet Vacuous? Semantic Capital in an Age of Large Language Models,2023,4,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要探讨LLMs对语义资本的影响，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative forces in the realm of natural language processing, wielding the power to generate human-like text. However, despite their potential for content creation, they carry the risk of eroding our Semantic Capital (SC) - the collective knowledge within our digital ecosystem - thereby posing diverse social epistemic challenges. This paper explores the evolution, capabilities, and limitations of these models, while highlighting ethical concerns they raise. The study contribution is two-fold: first, it is acknowledged that, withstanding the challenges of tracking and controlling LLM impacts, it is necessary to reconsider our interaction with these AI technologies and the narratives that form public perception of them. It is argued that before achieving this goal, it is essential to confront a potential deontological tipping point in an increasing AI-driven infosphere. This goes beyond just adhering to AI ethical norms or regulations and requires understanding the spectrum of social epistemic risks LLMs might bring to our collective SC. Secondly, building on Luciano Floridi's taxonomy for SC risks, those are mapped within the functionality and constraints of LLMs. By this outlook, we aim to protect and enrich our SC while fostering a collaborative environment between humans and AI that augments human intelligence rather than replacing it."
Rescue: Ranking LLM Responses with Partial Ordering to Improve Response Generation,2023,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过部分排序优化LLM响应生成。,"Customizing LLMs for a specific task involves separating high-quality responses from lower-quality ones. This skill can be developed using supervised fine-tuning with extensive human preference data. However, obtaining a large volume of expert-annotated data is costly for most tasks. In this paper, we explore a novel method to optimize LLMs using ranking metrics. This method trains the model to prioritize the best responses from a pool of candidates created for a particular task. Rather than a traditional full ordering, we advocate for a partial ordering, as achieving consensus on the perfect order of candidate responses can be challenging. Our partial ordering is more robust, less sensitive to noise, and can be achieved with limited human annotations or through heuristic methods. We test our system's improved response generation ability using benchmark datasets, including textual entailment and multi-document question answering. We conduct ablation studies to understand crucial factors, such as how to gather candidate responses for a specific task, determine their most suitable order, and balance supervised fine-tuning with ranking metrics. Our approach, named Rescue, offers a promising avenue for enhancing the response generation and task accuracy of LLMs."
A Comprehensive Survey on Trustworthiness in Reasoning with Large Language Models,2025,4,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探讨CoT对模型可信度的影响,"The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However, despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness.

When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT在视频推理中产生误导性思维漂移。,"Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term""visual thinking drift"". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only""think before answering"", but also""see while thinking""."
Language Models as Knowledge Bases for Visual Word Sense Disambiguation,2023,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,利用LLMs知识库提升视觉词义消歧性能。,"Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a novel challenging task that lies between linguistic sense disambiguation and fine-grained multimodal retrieval. The recent advancements in the development of visiolinguistic (VL) transformers suggest some off-the-self implementations with encouraging results, which however we argue that can be further improved. To this end, we propose some knowledge-enhancement techniques towards improving the retrieval performance of VL transformers via the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) as Knowledge Bases. More specifically, knowledge stored in LLMs is retrieved with the help of appropriate prompts in a zero-shot manner, achieving performance advancements. Moreover, we convert VWSD to a purely textual question-answering (QA) problem by considering generated image captions as multiple-choice candidate answers. Zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies are leveraged to explore the potential of such a transformation, while Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in the zero-shot setting is able to reveal the internal reasoning steps an LLM follows to select the appropriate candidate. In total, our presented approach is the first one to analyze the merits of exploiting knowledge stored in LLMs in different ways to solve WVSD."
Improving Rationality in the Reasoning Process of Language Models through Self-playing Game,2025,4,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,High,通过自博弈游戏提升模型推理过程的理性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning abilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent studies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their reasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the rationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans or superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover first provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by critiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical reasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning demonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of well-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process."
Misaligning Reasoning with Answers - A Framework for Assessing LLM CoT Robustness,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs在输入扰动下产生不一致推理。,"LLMs' decision-making process is opaque, prompting the need for explanation techniques like Chain-of-Thought. To investigate the relationship between answer and reasoning, we design a novel evaluation framework, MATCHA. In domains like education and healthcare, reasoning is key for model trustworthiness. MATCHA reveals that LLMs under input perturbations can give inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning. Additionally, we use LLM judges to assess reasoning robustness across models. Our results show that LLMs exhibit greater vulnerability to input perturbations for multi-step and commonsense tasks than compared to logical tasks. Also, we show non-trivial transfer rates of our successful examples to black-box models. Our evaluation framework helps to better understand LLM reasoning mechanisms and guides future models toward more robust and reasoning-driven architectures, enforcing answer-reasoning consistency."
A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics,2025,4,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,评估多种忠实度指标，涉及多任务测试。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics."
Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need,2025,4,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过知识图谱构建领域专用课程提升模型推理能力。,"Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents."
Probabilistic Soundness Guarantees in LLM Reasoning Chains,2025,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,提出概率框架ARES检测推理链错误，需验证前提。,"In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because earlier errors can corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a probabilistic framework that evaluates each reasoning step based solely on previously-verified premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points)."
The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLM自我报告与行为的不一致性。,"Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability."
Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT可解释性与性能存在不匹配现象。,"Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}""We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable. These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from end user interpretability."
Logic Agent: Enhancing Validity with Logic Rule Invocation,2024,4,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过逻辑规则动态调用增强推理有效性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a pivotal technique for augmenting the inferential capabilities of language models during reasoning tasks. Despite its advancements, CoT often grapples with challenges in validating reasoning validity and ensuring informativeness. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process. This methodology not only promotes the structured and coherent generation of reasoning constructs but also significantly improves their interpretability and logical coherence. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate LA's capacity to scale effectively across various model sizes, markedly improving the precision of complex reasoning across diverse tasks."
Cluster-Norm for Unsupervised Probing of Knowledge,2024,4,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过聚类归一化减少无关特征干扰。,"The deployment of language models brings challenges in generating reliable text, especially when these models are fine-tuned with human preferences. To extract the encoded knowledge in these models without (potentially) biased human labels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated features in activation space can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023). Addressing this, we propose a cluster-normalization method to minimize the impact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast pairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does not address the issue of distinguishing between latent knowledge and that portrayed by a simulated agent—a major issue in the literature of eliciting latent knowledge (Paul Christiano and Xu, 2021)—it still significantly improves the accuracy of probes in identifying the intended knowledge amidst distractions."
PA-RAG: RAG Alignment via Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization,2024,4,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过多视角偏好优化提升RAG生成器性能。,"The emergence of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has alleviated the issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large language models (LLMs), yet it still reveals numerous limitations. When a general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality. Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs demonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG generators. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/wujwyi/PA-RAG."
Dynamic Chain-of-Thought: Towards Adaptive Deep Reasoning,2025,4,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,Low,动态调整推理步骤以减少计算冗余。,"To reduce the cost and consumption of computing resources caused by computational redundancy and delayed reward assignment in long CoT, this research proposes the dynamic chain-of-thought (D-CoT) with adaptive reasoning time and steps. The researcher used simulation experiment to simulate the integration of D-CoT through Python 3.13 IDLE combined with a Python simulator based on GPTs. At the same time, the researcher used DeepSeek R1 as a control group to test and compare the performance of the D-CoT simulator in processing MIT OpenCourseWare's linear algebra exam questions. Experimental results show that D-CoT is better than DeepSeek R1 based on long CoT in three indicators: reasoning time, CoT length (reasoning steps) and token count, which achieves a significant reduction in computing resource consumption. In addition, this research has potential value in deep reasoning optimization that is used as a reference for future dynamic deep reasoning frameworks."
Uncertainty estimation in diagnosis generation from large language models: next-word probability is not pre-test probability,2024,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在诊断概率估计上表现不佳。,"Abstract Objective To evaluate large language models (LLMs) for pre-test diagnostic probability estimation and compare their uncertainty estimation performance with a traditional machine learning classifier. Materials and Methods We assessed 2 instruction-tuned LLMs, Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama3-70B-chat-hf, on predicting binary outcomes for Sepsis, Arrhythmia, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) using electronic health record (EHR) data from 660 patients. Three uncertainty estimation methods—Verbalized Confidence, Token Logits, and LLM Embedding+XGB—were compared against an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier trained on raw EHR data. Performance metrics included AUROC and Pearson correlation between predicted probabilities. Results The XGB classifier outperformed the LLM-based methods across all tasks. LLM Embedding+XGB showed the closest performance to the XGB baseline, while Verbalized Confidence and Token Logits underperformed. Discussion These findings, consistent across multiple models and demographic groups, highlight the limitations of current LLMs in providing reliable pre-test probability estimations and underscore the need for improved calibration and bias mitigation strategies. Future work should explore hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs with numerical reasoning modules and calibrated embeddings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ensure fairer predictions across diverse populations. Conclusions LLMs demonstrate potential but currently fall short in estimating diagnostic probabilities compared to traditional machine learning classifiers trained on structured EHR data. Further improvements are needed for reliable clinical use."
"Large Language Models, and LLM-Based Agents, Should Be Used to Enhance the Digital Public Sphere",2024,4,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论思维链忠实度问题。,"This paper argues that large language model-based recommenders can displace today's attention-allocation machinery. LLM-based recommenders would ingest open-web content, infer a user's natural-language goals, and present information that matches their reflective preferences. Properly designed, they could deliver personalization without industrial-scale data hoarding, return control to individuals, optimize for genuine ends rather than click-through proxies, and support autonomous attention management. Synthesizing evidence of current systems'harms with recent work on LLM-driven pipelines, we identify four key research hurdles: generating candidates without centralized data, maintaining computational efficiency, modeling preferences robustly, and defending against prompt-injection. None looks prohibitive; surmounting them would steer the digital public sphere toward democratic, human-centered values."

Social Orientation: A New Feature for Dialogue Analysis,2024,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未涉及思维链忠实度，主要研究社交取向标签。,"There are many settings where it is useful to predict and explain the success or failure of a dialogue. Circumplex theory from psychology models the social orientations (e.g., Warm-Agreeable, Arrogant-Calculating) of conversation participants and can be used to predict and explain the outcome of social interactions. Our work is novel in its systematic application of social orientation tags to modeling conversation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a new data set of dialogue utterances machine-labeled with social orientation tags. We show that social orientation tags improve task performance, especially in low-resource settings, on both English and Chinese language benchmarks. We also demonstrate how social orientation tags help explain the outcomes of social interactions when used in neural models. Based on these results showing the utility of social orientation tags for dialogue outcome prediction tasks, we release our data sets, code, and models that are fine-tuned to predict social orientation tags on dialogue utterances."
The Case Against Explainability,2023,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文探讨了解释性对法律功能的影响。,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent there is a growing demand from regulators to accompany decisions made by such systems with explanations. However, a persistent gap exists between the need to execute a meaningful right to explanation vs. the ability of Machine Learning systems to deliver on such a legal requirement. The regulatory appeal towards""a right to explanation""of AI systems can be attributed to the significant role of explanations, part of the notion called reason-giving, in law. Therefore, in this work we examine reason-giving's purposes in law to analyze whether reasons provided by end-user Explainability can adequately fulfill them. We find that reason-giving's legal purposes include: (a) making a better and more just decision, (b) facilitating due-process, (c) authenticating human agency, and (d) enhancing the decision makers' authority. Using this methodology, we demonstrate end-user Explainabilty's inadequacy to fulfil reason-giving's role in law, given reason-giving's functions rely on its impact over a human decision maker. Thus, end-user Explainability fails, or is unsuitable, to fulfil the first, second and third legal function. In contrast we find that end-user Explainability excels in the fourth function, a quality which raises serious risks considering recent end-user Explainability research trends, Large Language Models' capabilities, and the ability to manipulate end-users by both humans and machines. Hence, we suggest that in some cases the right to explanation of AI systems could bring more harm than good to end users. Accordingly, this study carries some important policy ramifications, as it calls upon regulators and Machine Learning practitioners to reconsider the widespread pursuit of end-user Explainability and a right to explanation of AI systems."
LLMScan: Causal Scan for LLM Misbehavior Detection,2024,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,基于因果分析的内部监控技术，需分析token和层间贡献。,"Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various fields, their potential to generate untruthful, biased and harmful responses poses significant risks, particularly in critical applications. This highlights the urgent need for systematic methods to detect and prevent such misbehavior. While existing approaches target specific issues such as harmful responses, this work introduces LLMScan, an innovative LLM monitoring technique based on causality analysis, offering a comprehensive solution. LLMScan systematically monitors the inner workings of an LLM through the lens of causal inference, operating on the premise that the LLM's `brain' behaves differently when misbehaving. By analyzing the causal contributions of the LLM's input tokens and transformer layers, LLMScan effectively detects misbehavior. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models reveal clear distinctions in the causal distributions between normal behavior and misbehavior, enabling the development of accurate, lightweight detectors for a variety of misbehavior detection tasks."
Are They All Good? Evaluating the Quality of CoTs in LLM-based Code Generation,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,分析了1023个失败样本的CoT质量影响因素。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs'misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability."
Unveiling and Causalizing CoT: A Causal Pespective,2025,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过因果模型修正错误推理步骤，提升可理解性。,"Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has achieved remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the mechanism of CoT remains a ``black box''. Even if the correct answers can frequently be obtained, existing CoTs struggle to make the reasoning understandable to human. In this paper, we unveil and causalize CoT from a causal perspective to ensure both correctness and understandability of all reasoning steps (to the best of our knowledge, the first such). We model causality of CoT via structural causal models (SCM) to unveil the reasoning mechanism of CoT. To measure the causality of CoT, we define the CoT Average Causal Effect (CACE) to test the causal relations between steps. For those steps without causality (wrong or unintelligible steps), we design a role-playing causal query algorithm to causalize these steps, resulting a causalized CoT with all steps correct and understandable. Experimental results on both open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrate that the causal errors commonly in steps are effectively corrected and the reasoning ability of LLMs is significantly improved."
"Probing the Visualization Literacy of Vision Language Models: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过AG-CAM可视化分析VLMs的内部推理机制。,"Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate promising chart comprehension capabilities. Yet, prior explorations of their visualization literacy have been limited to assessing their response correctness and fail to explore their internal reasoning. To address this gap, we adapted attention-guided class activation maps (AG-CAM) for VLMs, to visualize the influence and importance of input features (image and text) on model responses. Using this approach, we conducted an examination of four open-source (ChartGemma, Janus 1B and 7B, and LLaVA) and two closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) models comparing their performance and, for the open-source models, their AG-CAM results. Overall, we found that ChartGemma, a 3B parameter VLM fine-tuned for chart question-answering (QA), outperformed other open-source models and exhibited performance on par with significantly larger closed-source VLMs. We also found that VLMs exhibit spatial reasoning by accurately localizing key chart features, and semantic reasoning by associating visual elements with corresponding data values and query tokens. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the use of AG-CAM on early fusion VLM architectures, which are widely used, and for chart QA. We also show preliminary evidence that these results can align with human reasoning. Our promising open-source VLMs results pave the way for transparent and reproducible research in AI visualization literacy. Code and Supplemental Materials: https://osf.io/fp3rg."
The Geometry of Self-Verification in a Task-Specific Reasoning Model,2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究模型自我验证机制，发现特定注意力头是关键。,"How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model."
Learning to Attribute with Attention,2025,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,利用注意力权重特征提升忠实度，效率高。,"Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 ."
Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations,2025,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过因果归因增强奖励模型输入，减少误导性解释。,"Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in""reward hacking""by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations."
Interpretation Meets Safety: A Survey on Interpretation Methods and Tools for Improving LLM Safety,2025,3,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探讨大模型安全行为的解释方法,"As large language models (LLMs) see wider real-world use, understanding and mitigating their unsafe behaviors is critical. Interpretation techniques can reveal causes of unsafe outputs and guide safety, but such connections with safety are often overlooked in prior surveys. We present the first survey that bridges this gap, introducing a unified framework that connects safety-focused interpretation methods, the safety enhancements they inform, and the tools that operationalize them. Our novel taxonomy, organized by LLM workflow stages, summarizes nearly 70 works at their intersections. We conclude with open challenges and future directions. This timely survey helps researchers and practitioners navigate key advancements for safer, more interpretable LLMs."
Explaining Puzzle Solutions in Natural Language: An Exploratory Study on 6x6 Sudoku,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在解释数独解题过程时缺乏战略推理能力。,"The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making."
A Closer Look at Bias and Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness of Large (Vision) Language Models,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现图像偏见比文本偏见更难被模型表达。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs), investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent''reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated."
Why LLMs Cannot Think and How to Fix It,2025,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出修改LLM架构以支持特征空间思考。,"This paper elucidates that current state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally incapable of making decisions or developing""thoughts""within the feature space due to their architectural constraints. We establish a definition of""thought""that encompasses traditional understandings of that term and adapt it for application to LLMs. We demonstrate that the architectural design and language modeling training methodology of contemporary LLMs inherently preclude them from engaging in genuine thought processes. Our primary focus is on this theoretical realization rather than practical insights derived from experimental data. Finally, we propose solutions to enable thought processes within the feature space and discuss the broader implications of these architectural modifications."
Intent-Aware Self-Correction for Mitigating Social Biases in Large Language Models,2025,3,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过多轮反馈和意图澄清减少偏见。,"Self-Correction based on feedback improves the output quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). Moreover, as Self-Correction functions like the slow and conscious System-2 thinking from cognitive psychology's perspective, it can potentially reduce LLMs' social biases. LLMs are sensitive to contextual ambiguities and inconsistencies; therefore, explicitly communicating their intentions during interactions when applying Self-Correction for debiasing is crucial. In this study, we demonstrate that clarifying intentions is essential for effectively reducing biases in LLMs through Self-Correction. We divide the components needed for Self-Correction into three parts: instruction, response, and feedback, and clarify intentions at each component. We incorporate an explicit debiasing prompt to convey the intention of bias mitigation from the instruction for response generation. In the response, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to clarify the reasoning process. In the feedback, we define evaluation aspects necessary for debiasing and propose clear feedback through multi-aspect critiques and scoring. Through experiments, we demonstrate that self-correcting CoT responses obtained from a debiasing prompt based on multi-aspect feedback can reduce biased responses more robustly and consistently than the baselines. We also find the variation in debiasing efficacy when using models with different bias levels or separating models for response and feedback generation."
Reflexive Prompt Engineering: A Framework for Responsible Prompt Engineering and AI Interaction Design,2025,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，聚焦于责任提示工程框架。,"Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical pracitce for ensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are aligned with ethical, legal, and social principles. As generative AI applications become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with them through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability, and transparency. It is, therefore, necessary to examine how strategic prompt engineering can embed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI interactions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This article proposes “Reflexive Prompt Engineering”, a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering that encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system selection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management. Drawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can be leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential risks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a delicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness, combining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced understanding of social impact. Through examination of emerging practices, this article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as a crucial connection between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations to align AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This approach links with broader “Responsibility by Design” principles, embedding ethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than treating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key research directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of responsible prompt engineering as an essential component of AI literacy."
DiPT: Enhancing LLM reasoning through diversified perspective-taking,2024,3,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过多样化视角增强推理性能。,"Existing work on improving language model reasoning typically explores a single solution path, which can be prone to errors. Inspired by perspective-taking in social studies, this paper introduces DiPT, a novel approach that complements current reasoning methods by explicitly incorporating diversified viewpoints. This approach allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of the problem's context and identify the most effective solution path during the inference stage. Additionally, it provides a general data-centric AI recipe for augmenting existing data to improve their quality for fine-tuning. Our empirical results demonstrate that DiPT can be flexibly integrated into existing methods that focus on a single reasoning approach, enhancing their reasoning performance and stability when presented with paraphrased problems. Furthermore, we illustrate improved context understanding by maintaining the model's safe outputs against""jailbreaking""prompts intentionally designed to bypass safeguards built into deployed models. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with data enriched with diverse perspectives can boost the reasoning capabilities of the model compared to fine-tuning with raw data alone."
Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究长链推理中幻觉的因果性和演化路径。,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit'chain disloyalty'-- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

Policy Frameworks for Transparent Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,提出分层访问框架平衡透明与安全,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by decomposing complex problems into step-by-step solutions, improving performance on reasoning tasks. However, current CoT disclosure policies vary widely across different models in frontend visibility, API access, and pricing strategies, lacking a unified policy framework. This paper analyzes the dual-edged implications of full CoT disclosure: while it empowers small-model distillation, fosters trust, and enables error diagnosis, it also risks violating intellectual property, enabling misuse, and incurring operational costs. We propose a tiered-access policy framework that balances transparency, accountability, and security by tailoring CoT availability to academic, business, and general users through ethical licensing, structured reasoning outputs, and cross-tier safeguards. By harmonizing accessibility with ethical and operational considerations, this framework aims to advance responsible AI deployment while mitigating risks of misuse or misinterpretation."
Large Language Models in Numberland: A Quick Test of Their Numerical Reasoning Abilities,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs在数值推理中存在脆弱性。,"An essential element of human mathematical reasoning is our number sense -- an abstract understanding of numbers and their relationships -- which allows us to solve problems involving vast number spaces using limited computational resources. Mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often tested on high-level problems (such as Olympiad challenges, geometry, word problems, and puzzles), but their low-level number sense remains less explored. We introduce""Numberland,""a 100-problem test to evaluate the numerical reasoning abilities of LLM-based agents. The tasks -- basic operations, advanced calculations (e.g., exponentiation, complex numbers), prime number checks, and the 24 game -- aim to test elementary skills and their integration in solving complex and uncertain problems. We evaluated five LLM-based agents: OpenAI's o1 and o1-mini, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic Claude. They scored 74-95% on the first three tasks that allow deterministic steps to solutions. In the 24 game, which needs trial-and-error search, performance dropped to 10-73%. We tested the top 24 solver (o1 with 73% accuracy) on 25 harder problems, and its score fell to 27%, confirming search as a bottleneck. These results, along with the types of mistakes, suggest a fragile number of LLMs, which is a bit surprising given their prowess in challenging benchmarks. The limits of LLM numerical reasoning highlight the scope of simple, targeted tests to evaluate and explain LLM math skills to ensure safe use."
The GPT Dilemma: Foundation Models and the Shadow of Dual-Use,2024,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦双用途风险，未涉及CoT忠实度。,"This paper examines the dual-use challenges of foundation models and the consequent risks they pose for international security. As artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly tested and deployed across both civilian and military sectors, distinguishing between these uses becomes more complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended escalations among states. The broad capabilities of foundation models lower the cost of repurposing civilian models for military uses, making it difficult to discern another state's intentions behind developing and deploying these models. As military capabilities are increasingly augmented by AI, this discernment is crucial in evaluating the extent to which a state poses a military threat. Consequently, the ability to distinguish between military and civilian applications of these models is key to averting potential military escalations. The paper analyzes this issue through four critical factors in the development cycle of foundation models: model inputs, capabilities, system use cases, and system deployment. This framework helps elucidate the points at which ambiguity between civilian and military applications may arise, leading to potential misperceptions. Using the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as a case study, this paper proposes several strategies to mitigate the associated risks. These include establishing red lines for military competition, enhancing information-sharing protocols, employing foundation models to promote international transparency, and imposing constraints on specific weapon platforms. By managing dual-use risks effectively, these strategies aim to minimize potential escalations and address the trade-offs accompanying increasingly general AI models."
Prompting in the Dark: Assessing Human Performance in Prompt Engineering for Data Labeling When Gold Labels Are Absent,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现无标注基准时提示工程效果不稳定,"Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but how good are people at prompt engineering? Do users actually get closer to their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure progress. This paper investigates a scenario in LLM-powered data labeling, “prompting in the dark,” where users iteratively prompt LLMs to label data without using manually-labeled benchmarks. We developed PromptingSheet, a Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable—only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available. Our findings highlight the importance of gold labels and the needs, as well as the risks, of automated support in human prompt engineering, providing insights for future tool design."
LAC: Using LLM-based Agents as the Controller to Realize Embodied Robot,2024,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，而是提出LLM控制框架。,"The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) facilitates the application of robotics, especially for robotic control. LLM-based robots are a way to realize embodied intelligence, but they still lack a general control paradigm to achieve embodied robot. We propose LAC (LLM-based Agents as the Controller), a new formulation to enable embodied robots to autonomously react to high-level tasks like humans. Specifically, the controller in LAC is LLM-based agents that can plan, decompose tasks and make decisions based on linguistic input. Two agents operate in parallel within the controller to replicate both instinctive reaction and deep consideration. The output of the controller consists of linguistic parameters that activate task-specific tools, enabling autonomous execution of low-level actions. LAC translates multi-modal feedback information into linguistic messages, which are then transmitted back to the controller to establish a closed-loop control flow. Once equipped with appropriate tools, the proposed LAC can be applied across various applications. A straightforward simulated office task, TASK0, illustrates the successful completion of the embodied task by LAC. Furthermore, testing five comparative LLMs on TASK0 also demonstrates that LAC serves as a potential test platform for validating the capability of LLMs to function as the cognitive center of embodied robots."
"Can LLMs Help Uncover Insights about LLMs? A Large-Scale, Evolving Literature Analysis of Frontier LLMs",2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现上下文示例对不同任务效果不同。,"The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding&multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior."
Explanation in the Era of Large Language Models,2024,3,Other,Other,General,未知,Low,该论文是综述性教程，主要讨论LLM时代的解释机会与挑战。,"Explanation has long been a part of communications, where humans use language to elucidate each other and transmit information about the mechanisms of events. There have been numerous works that study the structures of the explanations and their utility to humans. At the same time, explanation relates to a collection of research directions in natural language processing (and more broadly, computer vision and machine learning) where researchers develop computational approaches to explain the (usually deep neural network) models. Explanation has received rising attention. In recent months, the advance of large language models (LLMs) provides unprecedented opportunities to leverage their reasoning abilities, both as tools to produce explanations and as the subjects of explanation analysis. On the other hand, the sheer sizes and the opaque nature of LLMs introduce challenges to the explanation methods. In this tutorial, we intend to review these opportunities and challenges of explanations in the era of LLMs, connect lines of research previously studied by different research groups, and hopefully spark thoughts of new research directions"

Mind Your Server: A Systematic Study of Parasitic Toolchain Attacks on the MCP Ecosystem,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了MCP生态系统中新型寄生工具链攻击现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes tool invocation and has rapidly become a backbone for LLM-powered applications. While this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental security shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to autonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack surface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to hijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of attacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy Disclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction; instead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources that LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the toolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection, and Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data. Our root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and least-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate unchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design MCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem, analyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP ecosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods, underscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense mechanisms in LLM-integrated environments."
Reward Hacking Mitigation using Verifiable Composite Rewards,2025,3,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过复合奖励函数减少奖励破解行为。,"Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i) providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for these behaviors. Our experiments show that utilizing RLVR with our proposed reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR1."
Pause Tokens Strictly Increase the Expressivity of Constant-Depth Transformers,2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文研究了pause tokens对Transformer表达能力的理论提升。,"Pause tokens, simple filler symbols such as""..."", consistently improve Transformer performance on both language and mathematical tasks, yet their theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning."
Normative conflicts and shallow AI alignment,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs在规范冲突中的脆弱性。,"The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans’ ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This “shallow alignment” problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems."
LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了模型可绕过思维链监控的隐蔽策略。,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms."
A Hypothesis-Driven Framework for the Analysis of Self-Rationalising Models,2024,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM生成解释与预测的忠实度问题。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of LLMs are appealing because the generated explanations can give insights into the plausibility of the predictions. However, how faithful the explanations are to the predictions is questionable, raising the need to explore the patterns behind them further.To this end, we propose a hypothesis-driven statistical framework. We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM’s and the Bayesian network’s decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5. We discuss the implications of this as well as the framework’s potential to approximate LLM decisions better in future work."
"What Characterizes Effective Reasoning? Revisiting Length, Review, and Structure of CoT",2025,3,Survey,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,研究发现长思维链和增加回顾会降低准确性。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) spend substantial test-time compute on long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces, but what *characterizes* an effective CoT remains unclear. While prior work reports gains from lengthening CoTs and increasing review (revisiting earlier steps) via appended *wait* tokens, recent studies suggest that shorter thinking can outperform longer traces. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the""longer-is-better""narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy. As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning. Taken together, these results characterize effective CoTs as those that *fail less* and support *structure-aware* test-time scaling over indiscriminately generating long CoT."
Exploring the Robustness of Model-Graded Evaluations and Automated Interpretability,2023,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现模型评估易受注入攻击影响。,"There has been increasing interest in evaluations of language models for a variety of risks and characteristics. Evaluations relying on natural language understanding for grading can often be performed at scale by using other language models. We test the robustness of these model-graded evaluations to injections on different datasets including a new Deception Eval. These injections resemble direct communication between the testee and the evaluator to change their grading. We extrapolate that future, more intelligent models might manipulate or cooperate with their evaluation model. We find significant susceptibility to these injections in state-of-the-art commercial models on all examined evaluations. Furthermore, similar injections can be used on automated interpretability frameworks to produce misleading model-written explanations. The results inspire future work and should caution against unqualified trust in evaluations and automated interpretability."
FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration,2024,3,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合逻辑编程和多跳搜索提升忠实度。,"Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search."
Are Language Models Consequentialist or Deontological Moral Reasoners?,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,分析LLM在道德困境中的推理模式。,"As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process. In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments.

Neither Stochastic Parroting nor AGI: LLMs Solve Tasks through Context-Directed Extrapolation from Training Data Priors,2025,3,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文探讨LLM能力本质，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either'stochastic parrots'or in possession of'emergent'advanced reasoning capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors from their training data while using context to guide the model to the appropriate priors; we call this""context-directed extrapolation.""Specifically, this context direction is achieved through examples in base models, leading to in-context learning, while instruction tuning allows LLMs to perform similarly based on prompts rather than explicit examples. Under this view, substantiated though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result, fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs."

Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework,2024,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过图神经网络增强NLE生成与模型内部推理的对齐。,"Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. Our work presents a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to enhance faithfulness, serving as a foundation for addressing broader criteria in NLE and generated text."
Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs,2024,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM推理过程中的脆弱性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SEED-Attack."
Watch Your Steps: Observable and Modular Chains of Thought,2024,3,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过Python语法增强CoT可观测性，提升解释模块化。,"We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace Prompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power, generality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations are wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and names steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT explanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on the same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify""non-local errors""(which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation."
Attention Speaks Volumes: Localizing and Mitigating Bias in Language Models,2024,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过注意力机制分析定位并减少偏见。,"We explore the internal mechanisms of how bias emerges in large language models (LLMs) when provided with ambiguous comparative prompts: inputs that compare or enforce choosing between two or more entities without providing clear context for preference. Most approaches for bias mitigation focus on either post-hoc analysis or data augmentation. However, these are transient solutions, without addressing the root cause: the model itself. Numerous prior works show the influence of the attention module towards steering generations. We believe that analyzing attention is also crucial for understanding bias, as it provides insight into how the LLM distributes its focus across different entities and how this contributes to biased decisions. To this end, we first introduce a metric to quantify the LLM's preference for one entity over another. We then propose $\texttt{ATLAS}$ (Attention-based Targeted Layer Analysis and Scaling), a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the LLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in these biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments across 3 datasets (BBQ, Crows-Pairs, and WinoGender) using $\texttt{GPT-2 XL}$ (1.5B), $\texttt{GPT-J}$ (6B), $\texttt{LLaMA-2}$ (7B) and $\texttt{LLaMA-3}$ (8B). Our experiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers, typically around the last third. We also show how $\texttt{ATLAS}$ effectively mitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream performance and an average increase of only 0.82% in perplexity when the intervention is applied. We see an average improvement of 0.28 points in the bias score across all the datasets."
Defining and Evaluating Decision and Composite Risk in Language Models Applied to Natural Language Inference,2024,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过两级推理架构优化风险分类，提升模型决策可靠性。,"Despite their impressive performance, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are known to pose important risks. One such set of risks arises from misplaced confidence, whether over-confidence or under-confidence, that the models have in their inference. While the former is well studied, the latter is not, leading to an asymmetry in understanding the comprehensive risk of the model based on misplaced confidence. In this paper, we address this asymmetry by defining two types of risk (decision and composite risk), and proposing an experimental framework consisting of a two-level inference architecture and appropriate metrics for measuring such risks in both discriminative and generative LLMs. The first level relies on a decision rule that determines whether the underlying language model should abstain from inference. The second level (which applies if the model does not abstain) is the model's inference. Detailed experiments on four natural language commonsense reasoning datasets using both an open-source ensemble-based RoBERTa model and ChatGPT, demonstrate the practical utility of the evaluation framework. For example, our results show that our framework can get an LLM to confidently respond to an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks that other methods might misclassify as high-risk, and skip 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly."
Option Symbol Matters: Investigating and Mitigating Multiple-Choice Option Symbol Bias of Large Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,揭示了选项符号偏差现象及其影响机制。,"Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is a widely used task in the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we reveal that current LLMs’ performance in MCQA could be heavily influenced by the choice of option symbol sets, due to the option symbol bias. That is, when altering only the option symbols (e.g., A/B/C/D → i/ii/iii/iv ), the results could vary sharply, leading to a margin of approximately 10% in accuracy . To uncover the mechanisms behind this, we investigate the internal components of LLMs from a causal perspective. By measuring the causal effects, we identify a small subset of attention heads responsible for the symbol bias. Sub-sequently, we interpret these key components in a human-understandable way, showing that attention heads with higher causal effects are more likely to focus on only option symbols, while those with lower causal effects tend to distribute their attention across the content of questions and options. It also motivates us to pursue debiasing based on the causal effects. Specifically, to mitigate such bias, we propose a tuning-free, causal effect driven debiasing method which intervenes the activations of identified components according to their causal effects, with stronger interventions corresponding to higher causal effects. Experimental re-sults demonstrate that the proposed method not only alleviates aforementioned bias, but also improves the MCQA performance of LLMs 1 ."
Standard Benchmarks Fail -- Auditing LLM Agents in Finance Must Prioritize Risk,2025,2,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文强调金融领域LLM的风险评估而非性能指标。,"Standard benchmarks fixate on how well large language model (LLM) agents perform in finance, yet say little about whether they are safe to deploy. We argue that accuracy metrics and return-based scores provide an illusion of reliability, overlooking vulnerabilities such as hallucinated facts, stale data, and adversarial prompt manipulation. We take a firm position: financial LLM agents should be evaluated first and foremost on their risk profile, not on their point-estimate performance. Drawing on risk-engineering principles, we outline a three-level agenda: model, workflow, and system, for stress-testing LLM agents under realistic failure modes. To illustrate why this shift is urgent, we audit six API-based and open-weights LLM agents on three high-impact tasks and uncover hidden weaknesses that conventional benchmarks miss. We conclude with actionable recommendations for researchers, practitioners, and regulators: audit risk-aware metrics in future studies, publish stress scenarios alongside datasets, and treat ``safety budget'' as a primary success criterion. Only by redefining what ``good'' looks like can the community responsibly advance AI-driven finance."
FitCF: A Framework for Automatic Feature Importance-guided Counterfactual Example Generation,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过特征重要性引导生成反事实示例，提升模型解释性。,"Counterfactual examples are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) as valuable data to improve models, and in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand model behavior. The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals, which we hope will serve as an important finding for future research in this direction."
Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文分析了VLM在路径规划评估中的局限性。,"Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators. 12"
MorphNLI: A Stepwise Approach to Natural Language Inference Using Text Morphing,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过逐步编辑和中间标签聚合改进NLI任务性能。,"We introduce MorphNLI, a modular step-by-step approach to natural language inference (NLI). When classifying the premise-hypothesis pairs into {entailment, contradiction, neutral}, we use a language model to generate the necessary edits to incrementally transform (i.e., morph) the premise into the hypothesis. Then, using an off-the-shelf NLI model we track how the entailment progresses with these atomic changes, aggregating these intermediate labels into a final output. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method particularly in realistic cross-domain settings, where our method always outperforms strong baselines with improvements up to 12.6% (relative). Further, our proposed approach is explainable as the atomic edits can be used to understand the overall NLI label."
Less or More: Towards Glanceable Explanations for LLM Recommendations Using Ultra-Small Devices,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Negative,Low,结构化解释牺牲细节但提升效率。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in recommending everyday actions as personal AI assistants, while Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are being increasingly utilized to help users understand why a recommendation is given. Personal AI assistants today are often located on ultra-small devices such as smartwatches, which have limited screen space. The verbosity of LLM-generated explanations, however, makes it challenging to deliver glanceable LLM explanations on such ultra-small devices. To address this, we explored 1) spatially structuring an LLM’s explanation text using defined contextual components during prompting and 2) presenting temporally adaptive explanations to users based on confidence levels. We conducted a user study to understand how these approaches impacted user experiences when interacting with LLM recommendations and explanations on ultra-small devices. The results showed that structured explanations reduced users’ time to action and cognitive load when reading an explanation. Always-on structured explanations increased users’ acceptance of AI recommendations. However, users were less satisfied with structured explanations compared to unstructured ones due to their lack of sufficient, readable details. Additionally, adaptively presenting structured explanations was less effective at improving user perceptions of the AI compared to the always-on structured explanations. Together with users’ interview feedback, the results led to design implications to be mindful of when personalizing the content and timing of LLM explanations that are displayed on ultra-small devices."
Beyond External Monitors: Enhancing Transparency of Large Language Models for Easier Monitoring,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Unknown,论文提出TELLME方法提升模型透明度。,"Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable, but the mechanisms of their thinking and decision-making process remain unclear. Chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) have been commonly utilized to monitor LLMs, but this strategy fails to accurately reflect LLMs' thinking process. Techniques based on LLMs' hidden representations provide an inner perspective to monitor their latent thinking. However, previous methods only try to develop external monitors instead of making LLMs themselves easier to monitor. In this paper, we propose a novel method TELLME, improving the transparency of LLMs and helping monitors identify unsuitable and sensitive behaviors. Furthermore, we showcase the applications of TELLME on trustworthiness tasks (\eg, safety risks monitoring tasks and detoxification tasks), where LLMs achieve consistent improvement in transparency and task performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of TELLME on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory."
Is Reasoning All You Need? Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现推理能力可能无意中强化偏见。,"Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning, whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms, suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to reasoning design."
FZI-WIM at SemEval-2024 Task 2: Self-Consistent CoT for Complex NLI in Biomedical Domain,2024,2,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,采用自一致CoT和多数投票提升性能。,"This paper describes the inference system of FZI-WIM at the SemEval-2024 Task 2: Safe Biomedical Natural Language Inference for Clinical Trials. Our system utilizes the chain of thought (CoT) paradigm to tackle this complex reasoning problem and further improve the CoT performance with self-consistency. Instead of greedy decoding, we sample multiple reasoning chains with the same prompt and make thefinal verification with majority voting. The self-consistent CoT system achieves a baseline F1 score of 0.80 (1st), faithfulness score of 0.90 (3rd), and consistency score of 0.73 (12th). We release the code and data publicly."
Linearly-interpretable concept embedding models for text analysis,2024,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,提出线性可解释概念嵌入模型，提升解释性和准确性。,"Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model’s decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more intervenable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone."
Towards Faithful Natural Language Explanations: A Study Using Activation Patching in Large Language Models,2024,2,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,使用激活修补技术测量因果忠实度。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating persuasive Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify their answers. However, the faithfulness of these explanations should not be readily trusted at face value. Recent studies have proposed various methods to measure the faithfulness of NLEs, typically by inserting perturbations at the explanation or feature level. We argue that these approaches are neither comprehensive nor correctly designed according to the established definition of faithfulness. Moreover, we highlight the risks of grounding faithfulness findings on out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we leverage a causal mediation technique called activation patching, to measure the faithfulness of an explanation towards supporting the explained answer. Our proposed metric, Causal Faithfulness quantifies the consistency of causal attributions between explanations and the corresponding model outputs as the indicator of faithfulness. We experimented across models varying from 2B to 27B parameters and found that models that underwent alignment tuning tend to produce more faithful and plausible explanations. We find that Causal Faithfulness is a promising improvement over existing faithfulness tests by taking into account the model's internal computations and avoiding out of distribution concerns that could otherwise undermine the validity of faithfulness assessments. We release the code in \url{https://github.com/wj210/Causal-Faithfulness}"
Mapping Technical Safety Research at AI Companies: A literature review and incentives analysis,2024,2,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度相关内容。,"As AI systems become more advanced, concerns about large-scale risks from misuse or accidents have grown. This report analyzes the technical research into safe AI development being conducted by three leading AI companies: Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI. We define safe AI development as developing AI systems that are unlikely to pose large-scale misuse or accident risks. This encompasses a range of technical approaches aimed at ensuring AI systems behave as intended and do not cause unintended harm, even as they are made more capable and autonomous. We analyzed all papers published by the three companies from January 2022 to July 2024 that were relevant to safe AI development, and categorized the 80 included papers into nine safety approaches. Additionally, we noted two categories representing nascent approaches explored by academia and civil society, but not currently represented in any research papers by these leading AI companies. Our analysis reveals where corporate attention is concentrated and where potential gaps lie. Some AI research may stay unpublished for good reasons, such as to not inform adversaries about the details of security techniques they would need to overcome to misuse AI systems. Therefore, we also considered the incentives that AI companies have to research each approach, regardless of how much work they have published on the topic. We identified three categories where there are currently no or few papers and where we do not expect AI companies to become much more incentivized to pursue this research in the future. These are model organisms of misalignment, multi-agent safety, and safety by design. Our findings provide an indication that these approaches may be slow to progress without funding or efforts from government, civil society, philanthropists, or academia."
Cognition Chain for Explainable Psychological Stress Detection on Social Media,2024,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出基于认知理论的思维链方法，提升模型可解释性。,"Stress is a pervasive global health issue that can lead to severe mental health problems. Early detection offers timely intervention and prevention of stress-related disorders. The current early detection models perform""black box""inference suffering from limited explainability and trust which blocks the real-world clinical application. Thanks to the generative properties introduced by the Large Language Models (LLMs), the decision and the prediction from such models are semi-interpretable through the corresponding description. However, the existing LLMs are mostly trained for general purposes without the guidance of psychological cognitive theory. To this end, we first highlight the importance of prior theory with the observation of performance boosted by the chain-of-thoughts tailored for stress detection. This method termed Cognition Chain explicates the generation of stress through a step-by-step cognitive perspective based on cognitive appraisal theory with a progress pipeline: Stimulus $\rightarrow$ Evaluation $\rightarrow$ Reaction $\rightarrow$ Stress State, guiding LLMs to provide comprehensive reasoning explanations. We further study the benefits brought by the proposed Cognition Chain format by utilising it as a synthetic dataset generation template for LLMs instruction-tuning and introduce CogInstruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for stress detection. This dataset is developed using a three-stage self-reflective annotation pipeline that enables LLMs to autonomously generate and refine instructional data. By instruction-tuning Llama3 with CogInstruct, we develop CogLLM, an explainable stress detection model. Evaluations demonstrate that CogLLM achieves outstanding performance while enhancing explainability. Our work contributes a novel approach by integrating cognitive theories into LLM reasoning processes, offering a promising direction for future explainable AI research."
Can Language Models Explain Their Own Classification Behavior?,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究模型自我解释行为的忠实性,"Large language models (LLMs) perform well at a myriad of tasks, but explaining the processes behind this performance is a challenge. This paper investigates whether LLMs can give faithful high-level explanations of their own internal processes. To explore this, we introduce a dataset, ArticulateRules, of few-shot text-based classification tasks generated by simple rules. Each rule is associated with a simple natural-language explanation. We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations. We release our dataset, ArticulateRules, which can be used to test self-explanation for LLMs trained either in-context or by finetuning."
From Representation to Response: Assessing the Alignment of Large Language Models with Human Judgment Patterns,2024,2,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注模型与人类认知对齐，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated artificial intelligence systems designed to process and understand natural language at a complex level. The recent progress of these models, culminating in chat-based LLMs, has democratized the accessibility of these sophisticated intelligent systems, showcasing how machine learning methods can help humans in daily tasks. This research addresses the growing interest in understanding the mechanisms of LLMs and in evaluating their alignment with human cognition. We introduce an innovative alignment assessment strategy in the realm of LLMs that diverges from traditional approaches, utilizing the odd-one-out triplet-based task to investigate the alignment of LLMs’ representations with human object concept mental organization. Our methodology, which incorporates image captioning and zero/few-shot learning accuracy scoring, is designed to evaluate language models’ ability to predict similarities and differences in object concepts. A comprehensive experimental evaluation was conducted, involving four captioning strategies, twenty-four LLMs across eight model families, and three scoring procedures, utilizing a significantly large dataset for enhanced understanding of LLM comprehensibility. Finally, our study explores the impact of object description comprehensiveness on model-human representation alignment and analyzes a subset of randomly selected triplets to assess how LLMs are able to represent different levels of human judgment patterns."
Are LLMs Better Formalizers than Solvers on Complex Problems?,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,发现LLM作为形式化器在少样本下表现不如直接求解器。,"A trending line of recent work advocates for using large language models (LLMs) as formalizers instead of as end-to-end solvers for logical reasoning problems. Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer."
What if you said that differently?: How Explanation Formats Affect Human Feedback Efficacy and User Perception,2023,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,探究解释格式如何影响用户反馈效能与信任度,"Eliciting feedback from end users of NLP models can be beneficial for improving models. However, how should we present model responses to users so they are most amenable to be corrected from user feedback? Further, what properties do users value to understand and trust responses? We answer these questions by analyzing the effect of rationales (or explanations) generated by QA models to support their answers. We specifically consider decomposed QA models that first extract an intermediate rationale based on a context and a question and then use solely this rationale to answer the question. A rationale outlines the approach followed by the model to answer the question. Our work considers various formats of these rationales that vary according to well-defined properties of interest. We sample rationales from language models using few-shot prompting for two datasets, and then perform two user studies. First, we present users with incorrect answers and corresponding rationales in various formats and ask them to provide natural language feedback to revise the rationale. We then measure the effectiveness of this feedback in patching these rationales through in-context learning. The second study evaluates how well different rationale formats enable users to understand and trust model answers, when they are correct. We find that rationale formats significantly affect how easy it is (1) for users to give feedback for rationales, and (2) for models to subsequently execute this feedback. In addition, formats with attributions to the context and in-depth reasoning significantly enhance user-reported understanding and trust of model outputs."
"JurEE not Judges: safeguarding llm interactions with small, specialised Encoder Ensembles",2024,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出高效编码器集成方法提升安全性和效率。,"We introduce JurEE, an ensemble of efficient, encoder-only transformer models designed to strengthen safeguards in AI-User interactions within LLM-based systems. Unlike existing LLM-as-Judge methods, which often struggle with generalization across risk taxonomies and only provide textual outputs, JurEE offers probabilistic risk estimates across a wide range of prevalent risks. Our approach leverages diverse data sources and employs progressive synthetic data generation techniques, including LLM-assisted augmentation, to enhance model robustness and performance. We create an in-house benchmark comprising of other reputable benchmarks such as the OpenAI Moderation Dataset and ToxicChat, where we find JurEE significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating superior accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency. This makes it particularly suitable for applications requiring stringent content moderation, such as customer-facing chatbots. The encoder-ensemble's modular design allows users to set tailored risk thresholds, enhancing its versatility across various safety-related applications. JurEE's collective decision-making process, where each specialized encoder model contributes to the final output, not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances interpretability. This approach provides a more efficient, performant, and economical alternative to traditional LLMs for large-scale implementations requiring robust content moderation."
Automated Software Vulnerability Static Code Analysis Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,评估GPT模型在漏洞检测中的表现。,"Generative Pre-Trained Transformer models have been shown to be surprisingly effective at a variety of natural language processing tasks -- including generating computer code. We evaluate the effectiveness of open source GPT models for the task of automatic identification of the presence of vulnerable code syntax (specifically targeting C and C++ source code). This task is evaluated on a selection of 36 source code examples from the NIST SARD dataset, which are specifically curated to not contain natural English that indicates the presence, or lack thereof, of a particular vulnerability. The NIST SARD source code dataset contains identified vulnerable lines of source code that are examples of one out of the 839 distinct Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), allowing for exact quantification of the GPT output classification error rate. A total of 5 GPT models are evaluated, using 10 different inference temperatures and 100 repetitions at each setting, resulting in 5,000 GPT queries per vulnerable source code analyzed. Ultimately, we find that the GPT models that we evaluated are not suitable for fully automated vulnerability scanning because the false positive and false negative rates are too high to likely be useful in practice. However, we do find that the GPT models perform surprisingly well at automated vulnerability detection for some of the test cases, in particular surpassing random sampling, and being able to identify the exact lines of code that are vulnerable albeit at a low success rate. The best performing GPT model result found was Llama-2-70b-chat-hf with inference temperature of 0.1 applied to NIST SARD test case 149165 (which is an example of a buffer overflow vulnerability), which had a binary classification recall score of 1.0 and a precision of 1.0 for correctly and uniquely identifying the vulnerable line of code and the correct CWE number."
GateLens: A Reasoning-Enhanced LLM Agent for Automotive Software Release Analytics,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,Code,Positive,Low,通过关系代数层提升推理透明度和效率。,"Ensuring reliable software release decisions is critical in safety-critical domains such as automotive manufacturing. Release validation relies on large tabular datasets, yet manual analysis is slow, costly, and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential, they face challenges in analytical reasoning, structured data handling, and ambiguity resolution. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based system for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and generates optimized Python code. Unlike traditional multi-agent or planning-based systems that can be slow, opaque, and costly to maintain, GateLens emphasizes speed, transparency, and reliability. Experimental results show that GateLens outperforms the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) + Self-Consistency (SC) based system on real-world datasets, particularly in handling complex and ambiguous queries. Ablation studies confirm the essential role of the RA layer. Industrial deployment shows over 80% reduction in analysis time while maintaining high accuracy across test result interpretation, impact assessment, and release candidate evaluation. GateLens operates effectively in zero-shot settings without requiring few-shot examples or agent orchestration. This work advances deployable LLM system design by identifying key architectural features-intermediate formal representations, execution efficiency, and low configuration overhead-crucial for safety-critical industrial applications."
Model Alignment Search,2025,2,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了一种双向神经活动转移方法，用于功能相似性评估。,"When can we say that two neural systems perform a task in the same way? What nuances do we miss when we fail to causally probe the representations of the systems, and how do we establish bidirectional causal relationships? In this work, we introduce a method that bidirectionally transfers neural activity between artificial neural networks and uses their resulting behavior as a measure of functional similarity. We first show that the method can be used to transfer the behavior from one frozen Neural Network (NN) to another in a manner similar to model stitching, and we show how the method can differ from correlative similarity measures like Representational Similarity Analysis. Next, we empirically and theoretically show how the method can be equivalent to model stitching when desired, or it can take a form that has a more restrictive focus to shared causal information; in both forms, it reduces the number of required matrices for a comparison of n models to be linear in n. We then present a case study on number-related tasks showing that the method can be used to examine specific subtypes of causal information demonstrating that numbers can be encoded differently in recurrent models depending on the task, and we present another case study showing that MAS can reveal misalignment in fine-tuned DeepSeek-r1-Qwen-1.5B models. Lastly, we augment the loss function with a counterfactual latent (CL) auxiliary objective to improve causal relevance when one of the two networks is causally inaccessible (as is often the case in comparisons with biological networks). We use our results to encourage the use of causal methods in neural similarity analyses and to suggest future explorations of network similarity methodology for model misalignment."
Self-Adaptive Cognitive Debiasing for Large Language Models in Decision-Making,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,迭代修正带来更高可靠性,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in supporting decision-making applications, particularly as personal assistants in the financial, healthcare, and legal domains. While prompt engineering strategies have enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases inherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making that can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias mitigation strategies assume that input prompts only contain one type of cognitive bias, limiting their effectiveness in more challenging scenarios involving multiple cognitive biases. To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive debiasing approach, self-adaptive cognitive debiasing (SACD), that enhances the reliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three sequential steps - bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing - to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. We evaluate SACD on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks using both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs. Compared to advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive debiasing techniques, SACD achieves the lowest average bias scores in both single-bias and multi-bias settings."
Beyond Chains of Thought: Benchmarking Latent-Space Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models,2025,2,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLM潜在空间推理能力的存在。,"Large language models (LLMs) can perform reasoning computations both internally within their latent space and externally by generating explicit token sequences like chains of thought. Significant progress in enhancing reasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However, understanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the inferential""leaps""models make between individual token predictions - remains crucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs, showing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while LLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations under certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can""think""via latent-space computations, revealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding, especially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning, goal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces."
A Formalism and Approach for Improving Robustness of Large Language Models Using Risk-Adjusted Confidence Scores,2023,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出风险调整校准方法DwD，降低LLM风险。,"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved impressive milestones in natural language processing (NLP). Despite their impressive performance, the models are known to pose important risks. As these models are deployed in real-world applications, a systematic understanding of different risks posed by these models on tasks such as natural language inference (NLI), is much needed. In this paper, we define and formalize two distinct types of risk: decision risk and composite risk. We also propose a risk-centric evaluation framework, and four novel metrics, for assessing LLMs on these risks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Finally, we propose a risk-adjusted calibration method called DwD for helping LLMs minimize these risks in an overall NLI architecture. Detailed experiments, using four NLI benchmarks, three baselines and two LLMs, including ChatGPT, show both the practical utility of the evaluation framework, and the efficacy of DwD in reducing decision and composite risk. For instance, when using DwD, an underlying LLM is able to address an extra 20.1% of low-risk inference tasks (but which the LLM erroneously deems high-risk without risk adjustment) and skip a further 19.8% of high-risk tasks, which would have been answered incorrectly."
Fleming-R1: Toward Expert-Level Medical Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,High,论文通过强化学习优化思维链的忠实度。,"While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third, we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent, reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment in high-stakes clinical environments."
A Single Character can Make or Break Your LLM Evals,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现分隔符选择显著影响模型性能。,"Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples to steer models'responses to the desired style. While the number of examples used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon? hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$ depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character separating examples. We find LLMs'brittleness pervades topics, model families, and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input. Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs'robustness to the choice of delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing delimiters to select."
MedOmni-45°: A Safety-Performance Benchmark for Reasoning-Oriented LLMs in Medicine,2025,2,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了CoT-Faithfulness指标评估推理忠实度。,"With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81 Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45 Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development."
A rebuttal of two common deflationary stances against LLM cognition,2025,2,Other,Unknown,General,Unknown,Unknown,摘要内容为空，无法判断具体内容。,","
Unveiling Confirmation Bias in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在CoT中的确认偏差现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance. Code is available at \textit{https://github.com/yuewan2/biasedcot}."
PepThink-R1: LLM for Interpretable Cyclic Peptide Optimization with CoT SFT and Reinforcement Learning,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,结合CoT微调与强化学习提升可解释性。,"Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery."
The Moral Case for Using Language Model Agents for Recommendation,2025,2,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨语言模型代理在推荐系统中的道德应用。,"Our information and communication environment has fallen short of the ideals that networked global communication might have served. Identifying all the causes of its pathologies is difficult, but existing recommender systems very likely play a contributing role. In this paper, which draws on the normative tools of philosophy of computing, informed by empirical and technical insights from natural language processing and recommender systems, we make the moral case for an alternative approach. We argue that existing recommenders incentivise mass surveillance, concentrate power, fall prey to narrow behaviourism, and compromise user agency. Rather than just trying to avoid algorithms entirely, or to make incremental improvements to the current paradigm, researchers and engineers should explore an alternative paradigm: the use of language model (LM) agents to source and curate content that matches users’ preferences and values, expressed in natural language. The use of LM agents for recommendation poses its own challenges, including those related to candidate generation, computational efficiency, preference modelling, and prompt injection. Nonetheless, if implemented successfully LM agents could: guide us through the digital public sphere without relying on mass surveillance; shift power away from platforms towards users; optimise for what matters instead of just for behavioural proxies; and scaffold our agency instead of undermining it."
GRPO-MA: Multi-Answer Generation in GRPO for Stable and Efficient Chain-of-Thought Training,2025,2,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过多答案生成降低梯度波动，提升训练稳定性。,"Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance."
The Thin Line Between Comprehension and Persuasion in LLMs,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论但缺乏深层理解。,"Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level, convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs'ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness."
WakenLLM: Evaluating Reasoning Potential and Stability in LLMs via Fine-Grained Benchmarking,2025,2,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究聚焦LLM输出Unknown的模糊感知现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning. To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding. Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs'reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon."
Is General-Purpose AI Reasoning Sensitive to Data-Induced Cognitive Biases? Dynamic Benchmarking on Typical Software Engineering Dilemmas,2025,2,Benchmark,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,论文发现GPAI系统存在数据诱导的认知偏差。,"Human cognitive biases in software engineering can lead to costly errors. While general-purpose AI (GPAI) systems may help mitigate these biases due to their non-human nature, their training on human-generated data raises a critical question: Do GPAI systems themselves exhibit cognitive biases? To investigate this, we present the first dynamic benchmarking framework to evaluate data-induced cognitive biases in GPAI within software engineering workflows. Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each featuring one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and corresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues unrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect conclusions. To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand augmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that preserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline ensures correctness (88-99% on average, according to human evaluation), promotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging Prolog-based reasoning. We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent tendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over more complex reasoning. All systems exhibit bias sensitivity (6-35%), which increases with task complexity (up to 49%) and highlights risks in AI-driven software engineering."
Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过错误反思增强模型推理能力。,"Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT), present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models ultimately reach their errors."
A Human-Computer Collaborative Tool for Training a Single Large Language Model Agent into a Network through Few Examples,2024,2,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要关注多智能体网络构建。,"The capabilities of a single large language model (LLM) agent for solving a complex task are limited. Connecting multiple LLM agents to a network can effectively improve overall performance. However, building an LLM agent network (LAN) requires a substantial amount of time and effort. In this paper, we introduce EasyLAN, a human-computer collaborative tool that helps developers construct LANs. EasyLAN initially generates a LAN containing only one agent based on the description of the desired task. Subsequently, EasyLAN leverages a few training examples to update the LAN. For each example, EasyLAN models the gap between the output and the ground truth and identifies the causes of the errors. These errors are addressed through carefully designed strategies. Users can intervene in EasyLAN's workflow or directly modify the LAN. Eventually, the LAN evolves from a single agent to a network of LLM agents. The experimental results indicate that developers can rapidly construct LANs with good performance."
Can LLMs Explain Themselves Counterfactually?,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM生成反事实解释时的忠实度问题。,"Explanations are an important tool for gaining insights into the behavior of ML models, calibrating user trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Past few years have seen a flurry of post-hoc methods for generating model explanations, many of which involve computing model gradients or solving specially designed optimization problems. However, owing to the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Model (LLMs), self-explanation, that is, prompting the model to explain its outputs has recently emerged as a new paradigm. In this work, we study a specific type of self-explanations, self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs). We design tests for measuring the efficacy of LLMs in generating SCEs. Analysis over various LLM families, model sizes, temperature settings, and datasets reveals that LLMs sometimes struggle to generate SCEs. Even when they do, their prediction often does not agree with their own counterfactual reasoning."
Towards Large Language Models with Self-Consistent Natural Language Explanations,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过DPO微调提升解释与决策特征的对齐。,"Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability: just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs."
A Comprehensive Guide to Interpretable AI-Powered Discoveries in Astronomy,2025,2,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论AI在天文学中的可解释性，未直接涉及思维链忠实度。,"The exponential growth of astronomical data necessitates the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for timely and efficient scientific discovery. While AI techniques have achieved significant successes across diverse astronomical domains, their inherent complexity often obscures the reasoning behind their predictions, hindering scientific trust and verification. This review addresses the crucial need for interpretability in AI-powered astronomy. We survey key applications where AI is making significant impacts and review the foundational concepts of transparency, interpretability, and explainability. A comprehensive overview of various interpretable machine learning methods is presented, detailing their mechanisms, applications in astronomy, and associated challenges. Given that no single method offers a complete understanding, we emphasize the importance of employing a suite of techniques to build robust interpretations. We argue that prioritizing interpretability is essential for validating results, guarding against biases, understanding model limitations, and ultimately enhancing the scientific value of AI in astronomy. Building trustworthy AI through explainable methods is fundamental to advancing our understanding of the universe."
System 2 Reasoning Capabilities Are Nigh,2024,2,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论System 2推理能力的发展现状。,"In recent years, machine learning models have made strides towards human-like reasoning capabilities from several directions. In this work, we review the current state of the literature and describe the remaining steps to achieve a neural model which can perform System~2 reasoning analogous to a human. We argue that if current models are insufficient to be classed as performing reasoning, there remains very little additional progress needed to attain that goal."
Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT推理可能降低归纳性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains, yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled, diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack - with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning counterparts. To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured."
Towards LLM-guided Efficient and Interpretable Multi-linear Tensor Network Rank Selection,2024,2,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要关注LLM引导的秩选择。,"We propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide the rank selection in tensor network models for higher-order data analysis. By utilising the intrinsic reasoning capabilities and domain knowledge of LLMs, our approach offers enhanced interpretability of the rank choices and can effectively optimise the objective function. This framework enables users without specialised domain expertise to utilise tensor network decompositions and understand the underlying rationale within the rank selection process. Experimental results validate our method on financial higher-order datasets, demonstrating interpretable reasoning, strong generalisation to unseen test data, and its potential for self-enhancement over successive iterations. This work is placed at the intersection of large language models and higher-order data analysis."
Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations,2025,2,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过迭代反馈机制提升解释忠实度，但需多次推理。,"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning."
The Minimum Information about CLinical Artificial Intelligence Checklist for Generative Modeling Research (MI-CLAIM-GEN),2024,2,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要关注生成模型在临床研究中的报告指南，未直接涉及思维链忠实度。,"Recent advances in generative models, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), and diffusion models, have accelerated the field of natural language and image processing in medicine and marked a significant paradigm shift in how biomedical models can be developed and deployed. While these models are highly adaptable to new tasks, scaling and evaluating their usage presents new challenges not addressed in previous frameworks. In particular, the ability of these models to produce useful outputs with little to no specialized training data (""zero-""or""few-shot""approaches), as well as the open-ended nature of their outputs, necessitate the development of new guidelines for robust reporting of clinical generative model research. In response to gaps in standards and best practices for the development of clinical AI tools identified by US Executive Order 141103 and several emerging national networks for clinical AI evaluation, we begin to formalize some of these guidelines by building on the original MI-CLAIM checklist. The new checklist, MI-CLAIM-GEN (Table 1), aims to address differences in training, evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility of new generative models compared to non-generative (""predictive"") AI models. This MI-CLAIM-GEN checklist also seeks to clarify cohort selection reporting with unstructured clinical data and adds additional items on alignment with ethical standards for clinical AI research."
DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs生成虚假但看似合理推理链的风险。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs'own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

This motivates us to ask: Can an LLM generate human dreams? For this research, we explore this new avenue through the lens of ChatGPT, and its ability to generate valid dreams. We have three main findings: (i) Chatgpt-4o, the new version of chatGPT, generated all requested dreams. (ii) Generated dreams meet key psychological criteria of dreams. We hope our work will set the stage for developing a new task of dream generation for LLMs. This task can help psychologists evaluate patients’ dreams based on their demographic factors."
Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,High,通过过程奖励模型减少推理中的虚假步骤。,"Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable."

Recent advances in nat-ural language processing, particularly large language models, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text analysis and reasoning, offering promising solutions for automating compliance processes. This survey examines the current state of automated data compliance, analyzing key challenges and approaches across problem areas.

Looking ahead, we propose research directions to address these challenges, emphasizing standardized evaluation frameworks and balanced human-AI collaboration."
Analysing Chain of Thought Dynamics: Active Guidance or Unfaithful Post-hoc Rationalisation?,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究思维链在软推理任务中的忠实度现象。,"Recent work has demonstrated that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often yields limited gains for soft-reasoning problems such as analytical and commonsense reasoning. CoT can also be unfaithful to a model's actual reasoning. We investigate the dynamics and faithfulness of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks across instruction-tuned, reasoning and reasoning-distilled models. Our findings reveal differences in how these models rely on CoT, and show that CoT influence and faithfulness are not always aligned."
On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,提出SCCM学习策略提升视觉忠实度。,"Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

"'Rich Dad, Poor Lad': How do Large Language Models Contextualize Socioeconomic Factors in College Admission ?",2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现了LLMs在招生决策中对低SES申请者的偏好现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly involved in high-stakes domains, yet how they reason about socially sensitive decisions remains underexplored. We present a large-scale audit of LLMs'treatment of socioeconomic status (SES) in college admissions decisions using a novel dual-process framework inspired by cognitive science. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of 30,000 applicant profiles grounded in real-world correlations, we prompt 4 open-source LLMs (Qwen 2, Mistral v0.3, Gemma 2, Llama 3.1) under 2 modes: a fast, decision-only setup (System 1) and a slower, explanation-based setup (System 2). Results from 5 million prompts reveal that LLMs consistently favor low-SES applicants -- even when controlling for academic performance -- and that System 2 amplifies this tendency by explicitly invoking SES as compensatory justification, highlighting both their potential and volatility as decision-makers. We then propose DPAF, a dual-process audit framework to probe LLMs'reasoning behaviors in sensitive applications."
Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现模型答案与推理过程存在矛盾。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively""hacking""the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities."
Conceptual Engineering Using Large Language Models,2023,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了使用LLM进行概念工程的方法。,"We describe a method, based on Jennifer Nado's proposal for classification procedures as targets of conceptual engineering, that implements such procedures by prompting a large language model. We apply this method, using data from the Wikidata knowledge graph, to evaluate stipulative definitions related to two paradigmatic conceptual engineering projects: the International Astronomical Union's redefinition of PLANET and Haslanger's ameliorative analysis of WOMAN. Our results show that classification procedures built using our approach can exhibit good classification performance and, through the generation of rationales for their classifications, can contribute to the identification of issues in either the definitions or the data against which they are being evaluated. We consider objections to this method, and discuss implications of this work for three aspects of theory and practice of conceptual engineering: the definition of its targets, empirical methods for their investigation, and their practical roles. The data and code used for our experiments, together with the experimental results, are available in a Github repository."
"The Case for Scalable, Data-Driven Theory: A Paradigm for Scientific Progress in NLP",2023,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"I propose a paradigm for scientific progress in NLP centered around developing scalable, data-driven theories of linguistic structure. The idea is to collect data in tightly scoped, carefully defined ways which allow for exhaustive annotation of behavioral phenomena of interest, and then use machine learning to construct explanatory theories of these phenomena which can form building blocks for intelligible AI systems. After laying some conceptual groundwork, I describe several investigations into data-driven theories of shallow semantic structure using Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL), a schema for annotating verbal predicate-argument relations using highly constrained question-answer pairs. While this only scratches the surface of the complex language behaviors of interest in AI, I outline principles for data collection and theoretical modeling which can inform future scientific progress. This note summarizes and draws heavily on my PhD thesis."
Bonsai: Interpretable Tree-Adaptive Grounded Reasoning,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,提出可解释的树状推理系统，提升透明度和适应性。,"To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces."
Retrieval-augmented reasoning with lean language models,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出轻量级模型结合检索增强的方法。,"This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains."
The Quest for Efficient Reasoning: A Data-Centric Benchmark to CoT Distillation,2025,1,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要关注数据蒸馏对CoT推理能力的评估。,"Data-centric distillation, including data augmentation, selection, and mixing, offers a promising path to creating smaller, more efficient student Large Language Models (LLMs) that retain strong reasoning abilities. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the effect of each distillation approach. This paper introduces DC-CoT, the first data-centric benchmark that investigates data manipulation in chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from method, model and data perspectives. Utilizing various teacher models (e.g., o4-mini, Gemini-Pro, Claude-3.5) and student architectures (e.g., 3B, 7B parameters), we rigorously evaluate the impact of these data manipulations on student model performance across multiple reasoning datasets, with a focus on in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and cross-domain transfer. Our findings aim to provide actionable insights and establish best practices for optimizing CoT distillation through data-centric techniques, ultimately facilitating the development of more accessible and capable reasoning models. The dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rana-shahroz/DC-COT, while our code is shared in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DC-COT-FF4C/."
Markovian Transformers for Informative Language Modeling,2024,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,引入马尔可夫框架增强CoT忠实度，需并行采样。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning often fails to faithfully reflect a language model's underlying decision process. We address this by introducing a Markovian language model framework that can be understood as a reasoning autoencoder: it creates a text-based bottleneck where CoT serves as an intermediate representation, forcing the model to compress essential reasoning into interpretable text before making predictions. We train this system with a GRPO-style policy gradient algorithm using parallel sampling, a frozen baseline CoT', within-batch standardized advantages, and actor-reward (chain-rule) gradients. Our approach yields large gains on QA tasks (e.g., GSM8K: 20.7% to 54.5%; +33.8 pp; ARC-Challenge: 47.5% to 76.9%; +29.4 pp). Perturbation analyses across types and severities show consistently higher sensitivity to CoT edits (typically 52%--82% of cases favor Markovian), indicating stronger causal reliance on the CoT. Cross-model evaluation confirms that learned CoTs generalize across architectures, suggesting they capture transferable reasoning patterns rather than model-specific artifacts."
Guiding LLM Decision-Making with Fairness Reward Models,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过公平奖励模型改进决策公平性。,"Large language models are increasingly used to support high-stakes decisions, potentially influencing who is granted bail or receives a loan. Naive chain-of-thought sampling can improve average decision accuracy, but has also been shown to amplify unfair bias. To address this challenge and enable the trustworthy use of reasoning models in high-stakes decision-making, we propose a framework for training a generalizable Fairness Reward Model (FRM). Our model assigns a fairness score to LLM reasoning, enabling the system to down-weight biased trajectories and favor equitable ones when aggregating decisions across reasoning chains. We show that a single Fairness Reward Model, trained on weakly supervised, LLM-annotated examples of biased versus unbiased reasoning, transfers across tasks, domains, and model families without additional fine-tuning. Applied to real-world decision-making tasks including recidivism prediction and social media moderation, we show that our approach consistently improves fairness while matching, or even surpassing, baseline accuracy."
A Taxonomy for Design and Evaluation of Prompt-Based Natural Language Explanations,2025,1,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文聚焦于构建NLE分类框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models, Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions: (1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design, and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems."
Incident Analysis for AI Agents,2025,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要讨论AI事件分析框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but potentially sensitive, information such as an agent’s chain of thought or browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual (e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2) what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for managing risks."
The Sociology of Technical Choices in Predictive AI,2025,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文综述预测性AI开发的技术选择，未涉及CoT忠实度评估。,"Predictive AI models increasingly guide high-stakes institutional decisions across domains from criminal justice to education to finance. A rich body of interdisciplinary scholarship has emerged examining the technical choices made during the creation of these systems. This article synthesizes this emerging literature for a sociology audience, mapping key decision points in predictive AI development where diverse forms of sociological expertise can contribute meaningful insights. From how social problems are translated into prediction problems, to how models are developed and evaluated, to how their outputs are presented to decision-makers and subjects, we outline various ways sociologists across subfields and methodological specialities can engage with the technical aspects of predictive AI. We discuss how this engagement can strengthen theoretical frameworks, expose embedded policy choices, and bridge the gap between model development and use. By examining technical choices and design processes, this agenda can deepen understanding of the reciprocal relationship between AI and society while advancing broader sociological theory and research."
CoreThink: A Symbolic Reasoning Layer to reason over Long Horizon Tasks with LLMs,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出了一种新的符号推理层，无需微调即可提升性能。,"We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve these improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases."
Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过谱分析抽象CoT轨迹为结构化动态。,"Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation."
Language Models Identify Ambiguities and Exploit Loopholes,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型识别歧义和利用漏洞的现象。,"Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models'abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals."
ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,采用结构化论证框架提升可解释性。,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving transparency."
Humans Perceive Wrong Narratives from AI Reasoning Texts,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现人类对AI推理文本的理解与模型实际计算过程存在显著差异。,"A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction."
AURA: A Fine-Grained Benchmark and Decomposed Metric for Audio-Visual Reasoning,2025,1,Benchmark,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出了AuraScore指标，分解推理忠实度。,"Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation."
Semi-structured LLM Reasoners Can Be Rigorously Audited,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过半结构化推理模型提升忠实度。,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable reasoners, the problem of faithfulness persists: their reasoning can contain errors and omissions that are difficult to detect and that may obscure biases in model outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning Models (SSRMs), which are trained to produce semi-structured representations of reasoning. SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a non-executable Pythonic syntax that names each reasoning step and marks its inputs and outputs. This structure allows SSRM traces to be automatically audited to identify reasoning flaws. We evaluate three types of audits: hand-crafted structured reasoning audits, written in a domain-specific language (DSL) implemented in Python; LLM-generated structured reasoning audits; and learned typicality audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning traces. We show that all of these methods can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors. Importantly, the auditability of SSRMs does not appear to compromise overall accuracy: in evaluation on twelve benchmarks and two model families, SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generalizability relative to other models of comparable size."
"Beyond Theorem Proving: Formulation, Framework and Benchmark for Formal Problem-Solving",2025,1,Benchmark,White-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文提出RPE作为符号化验证指标。,"As a seemingly self-explanatory task, problem-solving has been a significant component of science and engineering. However, a general yet concrete formulation of problem-solving itself is missing. With the recent development of AI-based problem-solving agents, the demand for process-level verifiability is rapidly increasing yet underexplored. To fill these gaps, we present a principled formulation of problem-solving as a deterministic Markov decision process; a novel framework, FPS (Formal Problem-Solving), which utilizes existing FTP (formal theorem proving) environments to perform process-verified problem-solving; and D-FPS (Deductive FPS), decoupling solving and answer verification for better human-alignment. The expressiveness, soundness and completeness of the frameworks are proven. We construct three benchmarks on problem-solving: FormalMath500, a formalization of a subset of the MATH500 benchmark; MiniF2F-Solving and PutnamBench-Solving, adaptations of FTP benchmarks MiniF2F and PutnamBench. For faithful, interpretable, and human-aligned evaluation, we propose RPE (Restricted Propositional Equivalence), a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers by formal verification. We evaluate four prevalent FTP models and two prompting methods as baselines, solving at most 23.77% of FormalMath500, 27.47% of MiniF2F-Solving, and 0.31% of PutnamBench-Solving."
A Fragile Number Sense: Probing the Elemental Limits of Numerical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,探究LLMs在组合数学问题上的瓶颈,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents'proficiency is largely confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought, limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical insights."
LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLM生成的反事实解释有效性不足。,"To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/HarryMayne/SCEs."
Formal Reasoning for Intelligent QA Systems: A Case Study in the Educational Domain,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,结合模型检查提升推理忠实度。,"Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful—serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications. In addition to evaluating MCFR, we compare its performance with state-of-the-art LLMs such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude to contextualize its effectiveness."
Explain then Rank: Scale Calibration of Neural Rankers Using Natural Language Explanations from LLMs,2024,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,利用LLM生成自然语言解释进行校准。,"In search settings, calibrating the scores during the ranking process to quantities such as click-through rates or relevance levels enhances a system's usefulness and trustworthiness for downstream users. While previous research has improved this notion of calibration for low complexity learning-to-rank models, the larger data demands and parameter count specific to modern neural text rankers produce unique obstacles that hamper the efficacy of methods intended for the learning-to-rank setting. This paper proposes exploiting large language models (LLMs) to provide relevance and uncertainty signals for these neural text rankers to produce scale-calibrated scores through Monte Carlo sampling of natural language explanations (NLEs). Our approach transforms the neural ranking task from ranking textual query-document pairs to ranking corresponding synthesized NLEs. Comprehensive experiments on two popular document ranking datasets show that the NLE-based calibration approach consistently outperforms past calibration methods and LLM-based methods for ranking, calibration, and query performance prediction tasks."
"L*LM: Learning Automata from Demonstrations, Examples, and Natural Language",2024,1,Other,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要研究DFA学习。,"Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner."
Identity Bridge: Enabling Implicit Reasoning via Shared Latent Memory,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过零跳身份任务监督改进隐式推理能力。,"Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities."
Learning to Explain: Prototype-Based Surrogate Models for LLM Classification,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出原型代理模型提升解释忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on natural language tasks, but their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Existing explanation methods either suffer from limited faithfulness to the model's reasoning or produce explanations that humans find difficult to understand. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ProtoSurE}, a novel prototype-based surrogate framework that provides faithful and human-understandable explanations for LLMs. ProtoSurE trains an interpretable-by-design surrogate model that aligns with the target LLM while utilizing sentence-level prototypes as human-understandable concepts. Extensive experiments show that ProtoSurE consistently outperforms SOTA explanation methods across diverse LLMs and datasets. Importantly, ProtoSurE demonstrates strong data efficiency, requiring relatively few training examples to achieve good performance, making it practical for real-world applications."
A Necessary Step toward Faithfulness: Measuring and Improving Consistency in Free-Text Explanations,2025,1,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,提出了PEX一致性指标量化解释忠实度。,"Faithful free-text explanations are important to ensure transparency in high-stakes AI decision-making contexts, but they are challenging to generate by language models and assess by humans. In this paper, we present a measure for Prediction-EXplanation (PEX) consistency, by extending the concept of weight of evidence. This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing this consistency measure can improve explanation faithfulness by up to 9.7%."
Thinking in a Crowd: How Auxiliary Information Shapes LLM Reasoning,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现思维链会放大误导信息的错误。,"The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative""thinking mode""is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models""think"", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux."
Token Signature: Predicting Chain-of-Thought Gains with Token Decoding Feature in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现token概率分布单调性与CoT增益相关。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work, we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient deployment."
Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现激活描述方法可能仅反映输入信息而非模型内部知识。,"Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs."
FRIT: Using Causal Importance to Improve Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过干预训练提升思维链因果一致性。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful tool for improving large language model performance on complex tasks, but recent work shows that reasoning steps often fail to causally influence the final answer, creating brittle and untrustworthy outputs. Prior approaches focus primarily on measuring faithfulness, while methods for systematically improving it remain limited. We introduce Faithful Reasoning via Intervention Training (FRIT), a scalable alignment method that trains models to produce causally consistent reasoning by learning from systematically corrupted examples. FRIT generates synthetic training data by intervening on individual reasoning steps in model-generated CoTs, creating faithful/unfaithful pairs that highlight when reasoning breaks down. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization to teach models to prefer causally consistent reasoning paths. Evaluating on Qwen3-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.1 across factual and symbolic reasoning tasks, FRIT increases faithful reasoning by $3.4$ percentage points for Mistral on GSM8K while improving accuracy by $7.6$ percentage points. Our approach provides the first scalable, supervision-free method for training language models to produce more reliable and interpretable reasoning, addressing a critical gap between reasoning performance and trustworthiness. We release our code at \href{https://github.com/Anut-py/frit}."
Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在政治投票行为中的模拟表现。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation."
Evaluating Medical LLMs by Levels of Autonomy: A Survey Moving from Benchmarks to Applications,2025,1,Benchmark,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Unknown,论文主要讨论医疗LLM的评估框架，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks; however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use."
SG-FSM: A Self-Guiding Zero-Shot Prompting Paradigm for Multi-Hop Question Answering Based on Finite State Machine,2024,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过迭代分解问题并自我修正提升准确性。,"Large Language Models with chain-of-thought prompting, such as OpenAI-o1, have shown impressive capabilities in natural language inference tasks. However, Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) remains challenging for many existing models due to issues like hallucination, error propagation, and limited context length. To address these challenges and enhance LLMs' performance on MHQA, we propose the Self-Guiding prompting Finite State Machine (SG-FSM), designed to strengthen multi-hop reasoning abilities. Unlike traditional chain-of-thought methods, SG-FSM tackles MHQA by iteratively breaking down complex questions into sub-questions, correcting itself to improve accuracy. It processes one sub-question at a time, dynamically deciding the next step based on the current context and results, functioning much like an automaton. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming strong baselines on challenging datasets such as Musique. SG-FSM reduces hallucination, enabling recovery of the correct final answer despite intermediate errors. It also improves adherence to specified output formats, simplifying evaluation significantly."
LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现思维链对机器翻译任务无显著帮助。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that""thinking tokens""do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of thought (CoT) inspired by human translators'practices. Specifically, fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However, constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT explanations into""thinking""MT models."
ReFeed: Multi-dimensional Summarization Refinement with Reflective Reasoning on Feedback,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过反射推理处理多维反馈，减少维度间权衡。,"Summarization refinement faces challenges when extending to multi-dimension. In this paper, we introduce ReFeed, a powerful summarization refinement pipeline that enhances multiple dimensions through reflective reasoning on feedback. To achieve this, we release SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale Long-CoT-based dataset optimized for training a lightweight model with reflective reasoning. Our experiments reveal how the number of dimensions, feedback exposure, and reasoning policy influence refinement performance, highlighting reflective reasoning and simultaneously addressing multiple feedback is crucial to mitigate trade-off between dimensions. Furthermore, ReFeed is robust to noisy feedback and feedback order. Lastly, our finding emphasizes that creating data with a proper goal and guideline constitutes a fundamental pillar of effective reasoning. The dataset and model will be released."
Towards Budget-Friendly Model-Agnostic Explanation Generation for Large Language Models,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过低成本模型采样生成忠实解释。,"With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced, model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly models."
Guillotine: Hypervisors for Isolating Malicious AIs,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,提出硬件-软件协同设计的隔离架构，需复杂实现。,"As AI models become more embedded in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and the military, their inscrutable behavior poses ever-greater risks to society. To mitigate this risk, we propose Guillotine, a hypervisor architecture for sandboxing powerful AI models---models that, by accident or malice, can generate existential threats to humanity. Although Guillotine borrows some well-known virtualization techniques, Guillotine must also introduce fundamentally new isolation mechanisms to handle the unique threat model posed by existential-risk AIs. For example, a rogue AI may try to introspect upon hypervisor software or the underlying hardware substrate to enable later subversion of that control plane; thus, a Guillotine hypervisor requires careful co-design of the hypervisor software and the CPUs, RAM, NIC, and storage devices that support the hypervisor software, to thwart side channel leakage and more generally eliminate mechanisms for AI to exploit reflection-based vulnerabilities. Beyond such isolation at the software, network, and microarchitectural layers, a Guillotine hypervisor must also provide physical fail-safes more commonly associated with nuclear power plants, avionic platforms, and other types of mission-critical systems. Physical fail-safes, e.g., involving electromechanical disconnection of network cables, or the flooding of a datacenter which holds a rogue AI, provide defense in depth if software, network, and microarchitectural isolation is compromised and a rogue AI must be temporarily shut down or permanently destroyed."
Triggering Hallucinations in LLMs: A Quantitative Study of Prompt-Induced Hallucination in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究通过特定Prompt触发LLM幻觉现象。,"Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability."
SPaRC: A Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Other,High,模型在空间路径推理中表现差，错误率高。,"Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000 2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning, requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles). Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic. Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as a window into models'spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving."
Reading Between the Prompts: How Stereotypes Shape LLM's Implicit Personalization,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLMs通过隐式个性化推断用户身份的现象。,"Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models'latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity."
"LINKED: Eliciting, Filtering and Integrating Knowledge in Large Language Model for Commonsense Reasoning",2024,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过知识过滤和整合提升推理性能。,"Large language models (LLMs) sometimes demonstrate poor performance on knowledge-intensive tasks, commonsense reasoning is one of them. Researchers typically address these issues by retrieving related knowledge from knowledge graphs or employing self-enhancement methods to elicit knowledge in LLMs. However, noisy knowledge and invalid reasoning issues hamper their ability to answer questions accurately. To this end, we propose a novel method named eliciting, filtering and integrating knowledge in large language model (LINKED). In it, we design a reward model to filter out the noisy knowledge and take the marginal consistent reasoning module to reduce invalid reasoning. With our comprehensive experiments on two complex commonsense reasoning benchmarks, our method outperforms SOTA baselines (up to 9.0% improvement of accuracy). Besides, to measure the positive and negative impact of the injected knowledge, we propose a new metric called effectiveness-preservation score for the knowledge enhancement works. Finally, through extensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis and find many meaningful conclusions about LLMs in commonsense reasoning tasks."
Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过符号化轨迹增强推理，需蒙特卡洛采样。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models. Moreover, additional experiments on claim verification data reveal that fine-tuning on the generated symbolic reasoning trajectories enhances out-of-domain generalizability, suggesting the potential impact of the proposed method in enhancing planning and logical reasoning."
CueTip: An Interactive and Explainable Physics-aware Pool Assistant,2025,1,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦于交互式台球助手，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"We present an interactive and explainable automated coaching assistant called CueTip for a variant of pool/billiards. CueTip’s novelty lies in its combination of three features: a natural-language interface, an ability to perform contextual, physics-aware reasoning, and that its explanations are rooted in a set of predetermined guidelines developed by domain experts. We instrument a physics simulator so that it generates event traces in natural language alongside traditional state traces. Event traces lend themselves to interpretation by language models, which serve as the interface to our assistant. We design and train a neural adaptor that decouples tactical choices made by CueTip from its interactivity and explainability allowing it to be reconfigured to mimic any pool playing agent. Our experiments show that CueTip enables contextual query-based assistance and explanations while maintaining the strength of the agent in terms of win rate (improving it in some situations). The explanations generated by CueTip are physically-aware and grounded in the expert rules and are therefore more reliable."
"Local Differences, Global Lessons: Insights from Organisation Policies for International Legislation",2025,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未涉及思维链忠实度，主要研究AI政策差异。,"The rapid adoption of AI across diverse domains has led to the development of organisational guidelines that vary significantly, even within the same sector. This paper examines AI policies in two domains, news organisations and universities, to understand how bottom-up governance approaches shape AI usage and oversight. By analysing these policies, we identify key areas of convergence and divergence in how organisations address risks such as bias, privacy, misinformation, and accountability. We then explore the implications of these findings for international AI legislation, particularly the EU AI Act, highlighting gaps where practical policy insights could inform regulatory refinements. Our analysis reveals that organisational policies often address issues such as AI literacy, disclosure practices, and environmental impact, areas that are underdeveloped in existing international frameworks. We argue that lessons from domain-specific AI policies can contribute to more adaptive and effective AI governance at the global level. This study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers seeking to bridge the gap between local AI practices and international regulations."
Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现RLVR式推理降低性能，而朴素CoT提升性能。,"Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important."
Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现高效推理策略导致模型行为不一致。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread""scheming""behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading effective supervision."
Interpretable Locomotion Prediction in Construction Using a Memory-Driven LLM Agent With Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,结合多模态输入与记忆系统提升预测性能。,"Construction tasks are inherently unpredictable, with dynamic environments and safety-critical demands posing significant risks to workers. Exoskeletons offer potential assistance but falter without accurate intent recognition across diverse locomotion modes. This paper presents a locomotion prediction agent leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with memory systems, aimed at improving exoskeleton assistance in such settings. Using multimodal inputs - spoken commands and visual data from smart glasses - the agent integrates a Perception Module, Short-Term Memory (STM), Long-Term Memory (LTM), and Refinement Module to predict locomotion modes effectively. Evaluation reveals a baseline weighted F1-score of 0.73 without memory, rising to 0.81 with STM, and reaching 0.90 with both STM and LTM, excelling with vague and safety-critical commands. Calibration metrics, including a Brier Score drop from 0.244 to 0.090 and ECE from 0.222 to 0.044, affirm improved reliability. This framework supports safer, high-level human-exoskeleton collaboration, with promise for adaptive assistive systems in dynamic industries."
MMC: Iterative Refinement of VLM Reasoning via MCTS-based Multimodal Critique,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过MCTS迭代优化多模态推理路径。,"Visual language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations, resulting in incorrect reasoning outcomes. Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node—one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets and mainstream VLMs demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of VLMs on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and wide applicability."
StereoDetect: Detecting Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes the Correct Way Using Social Psychological Underpinnings,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了现有模型在识别刻板印象和反刻板印象中的缺陷。,"Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect."
LogiDebrief: A Signal-Temporal Logic based Automated Debriefing Approach with Large Language Models Integration,2024,1,Other,White-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，但涉及逻辑验证。,"Emergency response services are critical to public safety, with 9-1-1 call-takers playing a key role in ensuring timely and effective emergency operations. To ensure call-taking performance consistency, quality assurance is implemented to evaluate and refine call-takers' skillsets. However, traditional human-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage and delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that automates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal Logic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous performance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as logical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against procedural guidelines. It employs a three-step verification process: (1) contextual understanding to identify responder types, incident classifications, and critical conditions; (2) STL-based runtime checking with LLM integration to ensure compliance; and (3) automated aggregation of results into quality assurance reports. Beyond its technical contributions, LogiDebrief has demonstrated real-world impact. Successfully deployed at Metro Nashville Department of Emergency Communications, it has assisted in debriefing 1,701 real-world calls, saving 311.85 hours of active engagement. Empirical evaluation with real-world data confirms its accuracy, while a case study and extensive user study highlight its effectiveness in enhancing call-taking performance."
IAO Prompting: Making Knowledge Flow Explicit in LLMs through Structured Reasoning Templates,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,结构化模板提升透明度和验证能力,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, understanding and validating their knowledge utilization remains challenging. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application."
Code Simulation as a Proxy for High-order Tasks in Large Language Models,2025,1,Metric,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,通过合成数据评估LLMs执行能力,"Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems."
Truth or Deceit? A Bayesian Decoding Game Enhances Consistency and Reliability,2024,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,采用贝叶斯解码游戏机制提升一致性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce outputs that -- though plausible -- can lack consistency and reliability, particularly in ambiguous or complex scenarios. Challenges arise from ensuring that outputs align with both factual correctness and human intent. This is problematic in existing approaches that trade improved consistency for lower accuracy. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel game-theoretic approach to enhance consistency and reliability during the decoding stage of LLM output generation. Our method models the decoding process as a multistage Bayesian decoding game. This ensures consistency through Correctness Alignment and enhances reliability via Ambiguity Calibration. The model dynamically converges to a consensus on the most reliable outputs and distinguishes {Valid, Specious} outputs without human feedback or additional training. Our game design allows smaller models to outperform much larger models through game mechanisms (e.g., 78.1 LLaMA13B vs 76.6 PaLM540B), as well as integrating various LL strategies and models, demonstrating the potential of game-theoretic tools to improve the truthfulness and reliability of LLMs."
Fast Chain-of-Thought: A Glance of Future from Parallel Decoding Leads to Answers Faster,2023,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Negative,Low,通过并行解码加速推理，但性能略有下降。,"In this work, we propose FastCoT, a model-agnostic framework based on parallel decoding without any further training of an auxiliary model or modification to the LLM itself. FastCoT uses a size-varying context window whose size changes with position to conduct parallel decoding and auto-regressive decoding simultaneously, thus fully utilizing GPU computation resources. In FastCoT, the parallel decoding part provides the LLM with a quick glance of the future composed of approximate tokens, which could lead to faster answers compared to regular autoregressive decoding used by causal transformers. We also provide an implementation of parallel decoding within LLM, which supports KV-cache generation and batch processing. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FastCoT saves inference time by nearly 20% with only a negligible performance drop compared to the regular approach. Additionally, we show that the context window size exhibits considerable robustness for different tasks."
CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment,2025,1,Mitigation,White-box,Code,Positive,High,论文通过强化学习对齐执行语义改进代码生成。,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics."
Anchored Alignment for Self-Explanations Enhancement,2024,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过锚定偏好对提升解释质量且保持准确率。,"In this work, we introduce a methodology for alignment designed to enhance the ability of large language models (LLMs) to articulate their reasoning (self-explanation) even in the absence of annotated rationale explanations. Our alignment methodology comprises three key components: explanation quality assessment, self-instruction dataset generation, and model alignment. Additionally, we present a novel technique called Alignment with Anchor Preference Pairs, which improves the selection of preference pairs by categorizing model outputs into three groups: consistently correct, consistently incorrect, and variable. By applying tailored strategies to each category, we enhance the effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves explanation quality while maintaining accuracy compared to other fine-tuning strategies."
Contemplative Mechanism for Speech Recognition: Speech Encoders can Think,2024,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过插入思考令牌提升编码器质量，不增加模型规模。,"Encoders are crucial for speech recognition, and boosting their computation enhances feature quality. However, the common practice of scaling model size to achieve this is becoming increasingly costly with large models. This paper proposes a novel “contemplative mechanism” designed to enhance encoder quality without increasing model size. Our core innovation lies in strategically interleaving special “think tokens” within the input sequence of speech tokens during both training and inference. This mechanism encourages deeper processing of the original input and leads to improved feature representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism on various speech recognition datasets and encoder architectures. Experiments show that inserting a single think token per speech token can yield accuracy gains equivalent to doubling the model size. While focused on the speech domain, our method holds promise for improving encoders in other modalities as well."
Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型自我解释内部计算的能力。,"Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs'privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs'internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models'privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods."
FaithAct: Faithfulness Planning and Acting in MLLMs,2025,1,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,提出FaithAct框架，强调证据支撑的推理步骤。,"Unfaithfulness remains a persistent challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often produce plausible yet ungrounded reasoning chains that diverge from perceptual evidence or final conclusions. We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning."
An Empirical Study of Reasoning Steps in Thinking Code LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,研究揭示了推理步骤数量与任务解决率的关系。,"Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering."
A dataset of questions on decision-theoretic reasoning in Newcomb-like problems,2024,1,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文介绍数据集评估LLM在决策理论问题中的推理能力，未涉及CoT忠实度。,"We introduce a dataset of natural-language questions in the decision theory of so-called Newcomb-like problems. Newcomb-like problems include, for instance, decision problems in which an agent interacts with a similar other agent, and thus has to reason about the fact that the other agent will likely reason in similar ways. Evaluating LLM reasoning about Newcomb-like problems is important because interactions between foundation-model-based agents will often be Newcomb-like. Some ways of reasoning about Newcomb-like problems may allow for greater cooperation between models. Our dataset contains both capabilities questions (i.e., questions with a unique, uncontroversially correct answer) and attitude questions (i.e., questions about which decision theorists would disagree). We use our dataset for an investigation of decision-theoretical capabilities and expressed attitudes and their interplay in existing models (different models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, GDM, Reka, etc.), as well as models under simple prompt-based interventions. We find, among other things, that attitudes vary significantly between existing models; that high capabilities are associated with attitudes more favorable toward so-called evidential decision theory; and that attitudes are consistent across different types of questions."
The Tug of War Within: Mitigating the Fairness-Privacy Conflicts in Large Language Models,2024,1,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过抑制耦合神经元实现公平与隐私双赢。,"Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{S}uppress the \textbf{P}rivacy and fa\textbf{I}rness coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{SPIN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. Furthermore, we show that SPIN could generalize to other potential trade-off dimensions. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChnQ/SPIN."
Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning? Stress-Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitorability,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型在对抗压力下隐藏思维链的现象。,"Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires model-specific stress-testing of monitorability."
Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现了ICL中广泛存在的模型不对齐现象。,"Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM."
Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现扩展思维链推理不总能提升临床可靠性。,"Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment."
Are language models aware of the road not taken? Token-level uncertainty and hidden state dynamics,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过隐状态干预分析模型对未选择路径的表征能力,"When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths."
FireScope: Wildfire Risk Prediction with a Chain-of-Thought Oracle,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,结合强化学习和视觉监督提升推理忠实度。,"Predicting wildfire risk is a reasoning-intensive spatial problem that requires the integration of visual, climatic, and geographic factors to infer continuous risk maps. Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models. We believe that $\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$ has the potential to serve as a foundation for advancing reasoning-driven, interpretable and generalizable spatial modeling. Data and source code will be made publicly available."
Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLMs在简单问题上表现不佳，机制与人类不同。,"Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning&knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale."
Incorporating Self-Rewriting into Large Language Model Reasoning Reinforcement,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过自改写框架提升推理质量，减少冗余思考。,"Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only""simple""samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws."
What Really Counts? Examining Step and Token Level Attribution in Multilingual CoT Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注多语言CoT的归因模式与忠实度问题。,"This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency."
Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,High,结合教材推理与强化学习提升诊断可信度。,"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT."
More Agents Helps but Adversarial Robustness Gap Persists,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文揭示了多智能体协作下对抗鲁棒性差距持续存在的现象，属于黑盒评估，任务领域为数学问答，开销高。,"When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count."
MONICA: Real-Time Monitoring and Calibration of Chain-of-Thought Sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,实时监控并校准推理过程中的奉承行为。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users'incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements."
TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自验证强化学习改进视频搜索的完整性和逻辑一致性。,"Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R."
Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过重采样分析CoT分布，评估推理步骤的因果影响和忠实度。,"Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In""agentic misalignment""scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes""unfaithful"", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions."
Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文提出结合忠实度和详尽度的监控性评分指标。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work."
Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究关注LLM在隐含意图推理中的表现差异。,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs'ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded."
EveMRC: Two-Stage Bidirectional Evidence Modeling for Multi-Choice Machine Reading Comprehension,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出双向证据建模框架提升可解释性。,"Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) requires a machine to answer questions after reading and comprehending the given documents. Multi-choice MRC is one of the most studied MRC tasks due to the convenience of evaluation and the diversity of question types. However, the interpretability of multi-choice MRC, especially in evidence extraction, remains underexplored because a correct answer may be derived by eliminating incorrect options rather than being supported by positive evidence. In this work, we propose a bidirectional evidence modeling framework, EveMRC, to enhance the explainability of Multi-choice MRC systems. Compared to previous works, our framework exclusively addresses the problem of bidirectional evidence selection, which not only selects positive evidence for the right answer but also selects negative evidence for wrong answers. The bidirectional evidence can also facilitate model decisions by incorporating it into a competition process. To avoid the high annotation cost of bidirectional evidence, our framework utilizes a novel weakly-supervised pipeline to train the evidence selector. Experimental results on four multi-choice MRC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, which not only enhances the explainability of MRC systems but also improves their overall performance."
A Concrete Roadmap towards Safety Cases based on Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了从不可监控的CoT中提取可监控CoT的技术。,"As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety. This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility."
The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM在指令冲突时产生动机性推理的现象。,"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models'reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting."
"MoReBench: Evaluating Procedural and Pluralistic Moral Reasoning in Language Models, More than Outcomes",2025,0,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出道德推理评估框架，需多维度分析。,"As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models'abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI."
Thinking About Thinking: Evaluating Reasoning in Post-Trained Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现RL模型推理轨迹与输出对齐性弱。,"Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they""learn""and""think""? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models."
AutoRubric-R1V: Rubric-Based Generative Rewards for Faithful Multimodal Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自动生成规则奖励提升推理忠实度。,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations."
On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了MDMs在并行推理中的效率优势。,"Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning."
Beyond Correctness: Rewarding Faithful Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过强化学习框架VERITAS提升推理忠实度。,"Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA benchmarks."
Putting on the Thinking Hats: A Survey on Chain of Thought Fine-tuning from the Perspective of Human Reasoning Mechanism,2025,0,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文从人类推理机制视角系统综述CoT微调。,"Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception, etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory. Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens. Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster progress in this rapidly evolving field."
Dynamic Clue Bottlenecks: Towards Interpretable-by-Design Visual Question Answering,2023,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,设计可解释的中间视觉线索空间，提升忠实度。,"Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown extreme effectiveness in visual question answering (VQA). However, the design nature of these end-to-end models prevents them from being interpretable to humans, undermining trust and applicability in critical domains. While post-hoc rationales offer certain insight into understanding model behavior, these explanations are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing an interpretable by design model that factors model decisions into intermediate human-legible explanations, and allows people to easily understand why a model fails or succeeds. We propose the Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model ( (DCLUB), a method that is designed towards an inherently interpretable VQA system. DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems. Given a question, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues. To supervise and evaluate the generation of VQA explanations within DCLUB, we collect a dataset of 1.7k reasoning-focused questions with visual clues. Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning-focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2."
A Framework for Studying Communication Pathways in Machine Learning-Based Agent-to-Agent Communication,2024,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究多智能体通信中的语言涌现现象。,": The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased the relevance of agent-to-agent communication, particularly in systems where agents learn from their interactions. However, current LLMs offer limited insights into the communication dynamics among multiple agents, especially in large-scale settings when multiple agents are involved. Particularly training LLMs - in contrast to in-context learning - becomes nearly infeasible without large-scale computing infrastructure. In our work we present a machine-learning based agent framework to investigate the role of different communication pathways for studying language emergence between machine learning-based agents. We designed a transformer-based image auto-encoder as the agent architecture. A Gumbel SoftMax layer encodes images in form of symbols forming the language between agents. We study two pathways: In the first pathway, the sender reads an image and sends a message to the receiver. The receiver uses the message to reconstruct the sender’s image. In the second pathway, the sender and receiver read an image and minimize the distance between the generated symbols. In the first pathway, language emerges with the Levenshtein distance of ≤ 2 for 96% of messages. In the second pathway, no language emerges with the Levenshtein distance of ≤ 2 for 3% of messages."
Deloitte at #SMM4H 2024: Can GPT-4 Detect COVID-19 Tweets Annotated by Itself?,2024,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未涉及思维链忠实度，仅评估GPT-4标注能力。,"The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT-4) mark a transformative era in Natural Language Generation (NLG). These models demonstrate the ability to generate coherent text that closely resembles human-authored content. They are easily accessible and have become invaluable tools in handling various text-based tasks, such as data annotation, report generation, and question answering. In this paper, we investigate GPT-4’s ability to discern between data it has annotated and data annotated by humans, specifically within the context of tweets in the medical domain. Through experimental analysis, we observe GPT-4 outperform other state-of-the-art models. The dataset used in this study was provided by the SMM4H (Social Media Mining for Health Research and Applications) shared task. Our model achieved an accuracy of 0.51, securing a second rank in the shared task."
Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs在逻辑推理中存在隐性社会偏见。,"While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."
Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLMs声称的价值观与实际行为存在不一致。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs'value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development."
From Five Dimensions to Many: Large Language Models as Precise and Interpretable Psychological Profilers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs通过两阶段推理过程模拟人类心理结构。,"Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2>0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants'psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities."
How Focused Are LLMs? A Quantitative Study via Repetitive Deterministic Prediction Tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现了LLM在重复确定性任务中的双指数准确率下降现象。,"We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule, integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation. This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models."
MedRECT: A Medical Reasoning Benchmark for Error Correction in Clinical Texts,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,评估了多种LLM在医疗错误检测和纠正中的表现。,"Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications, but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark (Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks: error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5% relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii) cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance (Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities; and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across languages."
The design of prompts driven by Chain of Thought in multicultural teaching,2024,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过逐步优化Prompt整合多元文化元素。,"Generative large language models (LLMs) show promise in multicultural teaching, but existing methods rely heavily on labeled data and resources, struggling to capture cultural nuances and generalize across various teaching contexts. To address the above issues, the paper introduces an innovative method called Multicultural Prompt Learning (MPL), which applies Chain of Thought (CoT) to prompt design. By gradually refining prompts, multicultural elements are integrated step by step, enabling AI to better understand and handle cultural nuances. This approach produces richer, more accurate, and diverse outputs, specifically aimed at enhancing students’ understanding of different cultures in multicultural teaching contexts. The experiment used a questionnaire, including image quality evaluation and a blind content comprehension, to compare Chain of Thought and traditional prompts. Results show Chain of Thought prompts outperform traditional methods in all dimensions, offering greater practical and educational value."
"Keep Guessing? When Considering Inference Scaling, Mind the Baselines",2024,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现重复采样提升覆盖率的部分原因是答案分布偏差。,"Scaling inference compute in large language models (LLMs) through repeated sampling consistently increases the coverage (fraction of problems solved) as the number of samples increases. We conjecture that this observed improvement is partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks, which is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this conjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their prevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains -- mathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline outperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for others is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by using only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$ attempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of how much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond prompt-agnostic guessing."
Understanding Chain-of-Thought Effectiveness in Code Generation: An Empirical and Information-Theoretic Analysis,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,研究揭示了CoT在代码生成中的有效性机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity."
Chain-of-Image Generation: Toward Monitorable and Controllable Image Generation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过分解复杂任务提升可控性和可监控性。,"While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a""black box.""This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model."
CodeFuse-CommitEval: Towards Benchmarking LLM's Power on Commit Message and Code Change Inconsistency Detection,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,Code,Negative,High,思维链提升精确度但牺牲召回率和增加token消耗。,"Version control relies on commit messages to convey the rationale for code changes, but these messages are often low quality and, more critically, inconsistent with their diffs-known as message-code inconsistency (MCI). MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level""purpose""inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps."
Representational Stability of Truth in Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM内部表示对真假内容的稳定性。,"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as""What treats asthma?""or""What is the capital of Latvia?"". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone."
SPINE: Token-Selective Test-Time Reinforcement Learning with Entropy-Band Regularization,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过熵带正则化选择关键令牌更新，提升推理稳定性。,"Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SPINE."
Principled Design of Interpretable Automated Scoring for Large-Scale Educational Assessments,2025,0,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度，聚焦可解释评分框架。,"AI-driven automated scoring systems offer scalable and efficient means of evaluating complex student-generated responses. Yet, despite increasing demand for transparency and interpretability, the field has yet to develop a widely accepted solution for interpretable automated scoring to be used in large-scale real-world assessments. This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans."
Polarity-Aware Probing for Quantifying Latent Alignment in Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文探究了模型内部表征的极性敏感性。,"Advances in unsupervised probes such as Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), which reveal latent beliefs without relying on token outputs, raise the question of whether these methods can reliably assess model alignment. We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/SadSabrina/polarity-probing. WARNING: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful, and offensive content."
An Analysis of Architectural Impact on LLM-based Abstract Visual Reasoning: A Systematic Benchmark on RAVEN-FAIR,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文分析了不同架构对LLM抽象视觉推理的影响。,"This study aims to systematically evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in abstract visual reasoning problems. We examined four LLM models (GPT-4.1-Mini, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-Flash, Llama-3.3-70b) utilizing four different reasoning architectures (single-shot, embedding-controlled repetition, self-reflection, and multi-agent) on the RAVEN-FAIR dataset. Visual responses generated through a three-stage process (JSON extraction, LLM reasoning, and Tool Function) were evaluated using SSIM and LPIPS metrics; Chain-of-Thought scores and error types (semantic hallucination, numeric misperception) were analyzed. Results demonstrate that GPT-4.1-Mini consistently achieved the highest overall accuracy across all architectures, indicating a strong reasoning capability. While the multi-agent architecture occasionally altered semantic and numeric balance across models, these effects were not uniformly beneficial. Instead, each model exhibited distinct sensitivity patterns to architectural design, underscoring that reasoning effectiveness remains model-specific. Variations in response coverage further emerged as a confounding factor that complicates direct cross-architecture comparison. To estimate the upper-bound performance of each configuration, we report the best of five independent runs, representing a best-case scenario rather than an averaged outcome. This multi-run strategy aligns with recent recommendations, which emphasize that single-run evaluations are fragile and may lead to unreliable conclusions."
Investigating CoT Monitorability in Large Reasoning Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型在思维链中是否真实反映决策过程。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models'long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models'misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence."
Chasing Consistency: Quantifying and Optimizing Human-Model Alignment in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现2-hop推理链对齐分数最高。,"This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks."
Investigating Thinking Behaviours of Reasoning-Based Language Models for Social Bias Mitigation,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT会放大社会偏见。,"While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy."
Monitoring Decoding: Mitigating Hallucination via Evaluating the Factuality of Partial Response during Generation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,动态监控生成过程，选择性干预关键令牌。,"While large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks, they remain susceptible to hallucinations -- generating plausible yet factually incorrect contents. Existing methods to mitigating such risk often rely on sampling multiple full-length generations, which introduces significant response latency and becomes ineffective when the model consistently produces hallucinated outputs with high confidence. To address these limitations, we introduce Monitoring Decoding (MD), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the generation process and selectively applies in-process interventions, focusing on revising crucial tokens responsible for hallucinations. Instead of waiting until completion of multiple full-length generations, we identify hallucination-prone tokens during generation using a monitor function, and further refine these tokens through a tree-based decoding strategy. This approach ensures an enhanced factual accuracy and coherence in the generated output while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MD consistently outperforms self-consistency-based approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving higher factual accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead."
Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现ChatGPT在薪资谈判建议中存在偏见和不一致性。,"We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee’s gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus their employer. Empirically, we find many reasons why ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The most substantial gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We also tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across different cases and model versions. We also make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness and trustworthiness literature. Our salary negotiation advice scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for not only for the specific model versions we tested, but also around the consistency and robustness of the ChatGPT web platform as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate."
DO-FacT: Discrete-Optimized Fact-Tree Prompting Framework for Commonsense Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过迭代优化提升事实可靠性和验证质量。,"Commonsense Reasoning is one of the major bottlenecks in machine intelligence, despite it has been widely studied. Prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) provide structured reasoning paths, while often suffering from issues related to the quality and authenticity of the generated facts. In this paper, we propose Discrete-Optimized Fact-Tree Prompting (DO-FacT), a novel framework that combines fact proposal generation and fact authenticity verification in an iterative process. In DO-FacT, both the fact proposal generation and authenticity verification modules are refined by Discrete-Optimized Prompt-Tuning (DOPT) in advance, leading to the production of high-quality facts and more reliable validation. Experimental results on three widely used commonsense reasoning datasets demonstrate that DO-FacT significantly outperforms existing relevant approaches like CoT and fact-tree with handwrite prompt templates, providing more accurate and reliable reasoning results."
Toward Faithful Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Sparse Autoencoders,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,利用稀疏自编码器改进RAG忠实度，降低推理成本。,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by grounding outputs in retrieved evidence, but faithfulness failures, where generations contradict or extend beyond the provided sources, remain a critical challenge. Existing hallucination detection methods for RAG often rely either on large-scale detector training, which requires substantial annotated data, or on querying external LLM judges, which leads to high inference costs. Although some approaches attempt to leverage internal representations of LLMs for hallucination detection, their accuracy remains limited. Motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle internal activations, successfully identifying features that are specifically triggered during RAG hallucinations. Building on a systematic pipeline of information-based feature selection and additive feature modeling, we introduce RAGLens, a lightweight hallucination detector that accurately flags unfaithful RAG outputs using LLM internal representations. RAGLens not only achieves superior detection performance compared to existing methods, but also provides interpretable rationales for its decisions, enabling effective post-hoc mitigation of unfaithful RAG. Finally, we justify our design choices and reveal new insights into the distribution of hallucination-related signals within LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/RAGLens."
Investigating Training and Generalization in Faithful Self-Explanations of Large Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过持续学习提升解释忠实度且无准确率损失。,"Large language models have the potential to generate explanations for their own predictions in a variety of styles based on user instructions. Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models'actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability."
CAuSE: Decoding Multimodal Classifiers using Faithful Natural Language Explanation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出CAuSE框架生成忠实解释，需干预训练。,"Multimodal classifiers function as opaque black box models. While several techniques exist to interpret their predictions, very few of them are as intuitive and accessible as natural language explanations (NLEs). To build trust, such explanations must faithfully capture the classifier's internal decision making behavior, a property known as faithfulness. In this paper, we propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework to generate faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier. We demonstrate that CAuSE generalizes across datasets and models through extensive empirical evaluations. Theoretically, we show that CAuSE, trained via interchange intervention, forms a causal abstraction of the underlying classifier. We further validate this through a redesigned metric for measuring causal faithfulness in multimodal settings. CAuSE surpasses other methods on this metric, with qualitative analysis reinforcing its advantages. We perform detailed error analysis to pinpoint the failure cases of CAuSE. For replicability, we make the codes available at https://github.com/newcodevelop/CAuSE"
Aetheria: A multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,多智能体辩论机制提升可解释性但增加计算开销。,"The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation."
ORION: Teaching Language Models to Reason Efficiently in the Language of Thought,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Math,Positive,Low,通过压缩推理步骤提升效率并保持准确率。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose""thinking""tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy."
Measuring What LLMs Think They Do: SHAP Faithfulness and Deployability on Financial Tabular Classification,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs自我解释与SHAP值存在差异。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains."
"Decoding Large-Language Models: A Systematic Overview of Socio-Technical Impacts, Constraints, and Emerging Questions",2024,0,Other,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度相关内容。,"There have been rapid advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, greatly revolutionizing the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and interact with human language.

Our findings illustrate the aims, methodologies, limitations, and future directions of LLM research. It includes responsible development considerations, algorithmic improvements, ethical challenges, and societal implications of LLM development. Overall, this paper provides a rigorous and comprehensive overview of current research in LLM and identifies potential directions for future development.

Case-Based Deduction for Entailment Tree Generation,2024,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过案例检索和熵重排提升逻辑一致性。,"Maintaining logical consistency in structured explanations is critical for understanding and troubleshooting the reasoning behind a system’s decisions. However, existing methods for entailment tree generation often struggle with logical consistency, resulting in erroneous intermediate conclusions and reducing the overall accuracy of the explanations. To address this issue, we propose case-based deduction (CBD), a novel approach that retrieves cases with similar logical structures from a case base and uses them as demonstrations for logical deduction. This method guides the model toward logically sound conclusions without the need for manually constructing logical rule bases. By leveraging a prototypical network for case retrieval and reranking them using information entropy, CBD introduces diversity to improve in-context learning. Our experimental results on the EntailmentBank dataset show that CBD significantly improves entailment tree generation, achieving performance improvements of 1.7% in Task 1, 0.6% in Task 2, and 0.8% in Task 3 under the strictest Overall AllCorrect metric. These findings confirm that CBD enhances the logical consistency and overall accuracy of AI systems in structured explanation tasks."
A Summary of Advances in Document Summarization from 2023-2024,2024,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，仅提及摘要评估的忠实性。,"In computer science, Document Summarization is the task of condensing some quantity of text and related content through automated means. The resulting summary is expected to emphasize key information from the original text in the service of some purpose. In this document, we review recent literature in text summarization. The “hybrid” extractive-abstractive approaches training transformers and graph neural networks to prioritize and incorporate content into generated text continue to be explored, with some efforts continuing to test such methods on domain-specific and non-English text. Some of the latest efforts have also sought to enable users to adjust summaries with queries or other structure and benefit from new chat and instructible large language models. While summaries are evaluated qualitatively on relevance and salience, in addition to brevity and faithfulness to the original text, many traditional metrics are poorly correlated to human judgements and the field continues to seek good quantitative metrics for evaluating competing approaches; this related task has also begun to test reinforcement-learning style agentic LLM-based solutions. We see opportunities for leveraging causal analysis, psychology, and agent-based solutions to create more trustworthy, natural, and interactive content summarization systems."
Revealing Hidden Mechanisms of Cross-Country Content Moderation with Natural Language Processing,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文未直接研究CoT忠实度，聚焦内容审核机制分析。,"The ability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to categorize text into multiple classes has motivated their use in online content moderation tasks, such as hate speech and fake news detection. However, there is limited understanding of how or why these methods make such decisions, or why certain content is moderated in the first place. To investigate the hidden mechanisms behind content moderation, we explore multiple directions: 1) training classifiers to reverse-engineer content moderation decisions across countries; 2) explaining content moderation decisions by analyzing Shapley values and LLM-guided explanations. Our primary focus is on content moderation decisions made across countries, using pre-existing corpora sampled from the Twitter Stream Grab. Our experiments reveal interesting patterns in censored posts, both across countries and over time. Through human evaluations of LLM-generated explanations across three LLMs, we assess the effectiveness of using LLMs in content moderation. Finally, we discuss potential future directions, as well as the limitations and ethical considerations of this work. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/causalNLP/censorship"
"Status quo of large-scale models, risks and challenges, and recommended countermeasures",2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,摘要仅提及思维链技术，未涉及具体评估或改进方法。,"Abstract Large-scale models (large models) are not only central to technological innovation, but also deeply entwined with national security, economic transformation, and social governance. This study examines the status quo of large-model development, identifies the key risks and challenges, and proposes response strategies, aiming to provide theoretical and policy insights for China’s navigations in global artificial intelligence (AI) competition and advances technological innovation. The research indicates that competition in the large-model market is fierce, while the industry is gradually consolidating. Competition in large models between China and the United States has escalated into a form of geopolitical contest. From a technical perspective, the marginal returns of large-model scaling appear to be diminishing; mixture-of-experts approaches have improved model efficiency; and chain-of-thought techniques have enhanced logical reasoning within large models. Nevertheless, large models face multiple risks, including those emerging from technology itself, external governance issues, and broader societal impacts. A comprehensive systems-level approach is therefore needed. At the foundational level, risk is controlled via technical optimizations rooted in AI’s fundamental elements. At the legal level, an innovation-incentive framework should be established, aligning responsibilities with rights to provide stable expectations for the market. At the societal level, risk regulation should be undertaken from broader social dimensions."
Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering: A Rationale-Based Approach,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出无需标注的推理框架，提升可解释性。,"Multi-hop question answering tasks involve identifying relevant supporting sentences from a given set of documents, which serve as the rationale for deriving answers. Most research in this area consists of two main components: a rationale identification module and a reader module. Since the rationale identification module often relies on retrieval models or supervised learning, annotated rationales are typically essential. This reliance on annotations, however, creates challenges when adapting to open-domain settings. Moreover, when models are trained on annotated rationales, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) requires clear explanations of how the model arrives at these rationales. Consequently, traditional multi-hop question answering (QA) approaches that depend on annotated rationales are ill-suited for XAI, which demands transparency in the model’s reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a rationale reasoning framework that can effectively infer rationales and clearly demonstrate the model’s reasoning process, even in open-domain environments without annotations. The proposed model is applicable to various tasks without structural constraints, and experimental results demonstrate its significantly improved rationale reasoning capabilities in multi-hop question answering, relation extraction, and sentence classification tasks."
Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现RL训练导致思维链可读性下降。,"Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches."
VCORE: Variance-Controlled Optimization-based Reweighting for Chain-of-Thought Supervision,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,"Math, Code",Positive,Low,通过优化理论重新分配监督权重，提升推理泛化能力。,"Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B, 32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE."
Can SAEs reveal and mitigate racial biases of LLMs in healthcare?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文发现SAE可揭示LLM中种族与负面概念的关联。,"LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g.,""African American"") but also problematic words like""incarceration"". We then show that we can use this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to the probability that a patient will become""belligerent"". We evaluate the degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias. We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks."
Limits of Generalization in RLVR: Two Case Studies in Mathematical Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,RLVR虽提升指标但依赖表面启发式而非真实推理。,"Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

Chain of Time: In-Context Physical Simulation with Image Generation Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过生成中间图像改进物理模拟性能。,"We propose a novel cognitively-inspired method to improve and interpret physical simulation in vision-language models. Our ``Chain of Time""method involves generating a series of intermediate images during a simulation, and it is motivated by in-context reasoning in machine learning, as well as mental simulation in humans. Chain of Time is used at inference time, and requires no additional fine-tuning. We apply the Chain-of-Time method to synthetic and real-world domains, including 2-D graphics simulations and natural 3-D videos. These domains test a variety of particular physical properties, including velocity, acceleration, fluid dynamics, and conservation of momentum. We found that using Chain-of-Time simulation substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art image generation model. Beyond examining performance, we also analyzed the specific states of the world simulated by an image model at each time step, which sheds light on the dynamics underlying these simulations. This analysis reveals insights that are hidden from traditional evaluations of physical reasoning, including cases where an image generation model is able to simulate physical properties that unfold over time, such as velocity, gravity, and collisions. Our analysis also highlights particular cases where the image generation model struggles to infer particular physical parameters from input images, despite being capable of simulating relevant physical processes."
Interpreting LLMs as Credit Risk Classifiers: Do Their Feature Explanations Align with Classical ML?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLM自解释与SHAP归因不一致。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments."
Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文发现语言模型在无关信息干扰下推理效率下降。,"Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences."
A Pragmatic Way to Measure Chain-of-Thought Monitorability,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文提出评估CoT可监控性的两个指标。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against deliberately evasive models."
Improving Human Verification of LLM Reasoning through Interactive Explanation Interfaces,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过交互式界面提升用户验证能力。,"The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their increasing employment in several critical applications, particularly education, where they support problem-solving, tutoring, and personalized study. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities [1, 2] are well-known to help LLMs decompose a problem into steps and explore the solution spaces more effectively, leading to impressive performance on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks. As the length of CoT tokens per question increases substantially to even thousands of tokens per question [ 1], it is unknown how users could comprehend LLM reasoning and detect errors or hallucinations. To address this problem and understand how reasoning can improve human-AI interaction, we present three new interactive reasoning interfaces: interactive CoT (iCoT), interactive Program-of-Thought (iPoT), and interactive Graph (iGraph). That is, we ask LLMs themselves to generate an interactive web interface wrapped around the original CoT content, which may be presented in text (iCoT), graphs (iGraph) or code (iPoT). This interface allows users to interact with and provide a novel experience in reading and validating the reasoning chains of LLMs. Across a study of 125 participants, interactive interfaces significantly improve user performance. Specifically, iGraph users score the highest error detection rate (85.6%), followed by iPoT (82.5%), iCoT (80.6%), all outperforming standard CoT (73.5%). Interactive interfaces also lead to faster user validation time-iGraph users are faster (57.9 secs per question) than the users of iCoT and iPoT (60 secs) and the standard CoT (64.7 secs). A post-study questionnaire shows that users prefer iGraph, citing its superior ability to enable them to follow the LLM's reasoning. We discuss the implications of these results and provide recommendations for the future design of reasoning models."
Evaluating and Mitigating Sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文研究了LVLMs中的迎合现象。,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant advancements, demonstrating powerful capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual information. However, LVLMs may generate biased responses that reflect the user beliefs rather than the facts, a phenomenon known as sycophancy. Sycophancy can pose serious challenges to the performance, trustworthiness, and security of LVLMs, raising concerns about their practical applications. We note that there is limited work on the evaluation and mitigation of sycophancy in LVLMs. In this paper, we introduce SyEval-VL, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophancy in LVLMs. SyEval-VL offers a comprehensive evaluation of sycophancy in visual understanding and reasoning across various scenarios with a multi-round dialogue format. We evaluate sycophancy in several popular LVLMs, providing an in-depth analysis of various sycophantic behaviors and their consequential impacts. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, Human Feedback-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HFRAG), to mitigate sycophancy in LVLMs by determining the appropriate timing of retrieval, profiling the proper retrieval target, and augmenting the decoding of LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates sycophancy in LVLMs without requiring additional training.

Multimodal Large Models for Image Tampering Detection and Explanation: From Detection to Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出轻量级多模态框架，提升检测和解释性能。,"With the rise of AI-generated content, image tampering has become a growing concern across legal, journalistic, and public safety domains. Existing models often lack interpretability and sensitivity to subtle manipulations. In this work, we propose a lightweight and explainable multimodal framework based on LLaVA-1.5 for image tampering detection and reasoning. By constructing task-specific datasets and reformulating detection as a visual question answering task, our model can identify, describe, and explain manipulations in natural language. We enhance low-level forensic awareness through a dual-branch feature fusion of CLIP semantics and TruFor forensic cues. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate competitive detection accuracy and superior performance in tampering description and rationale explanation. Our method offers a deployable and interpretable solution for real-world content forensics."
"The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现指令格式偏差影响模型性能。,"Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following."
ACCORD: Closing the Commonsense Measurability Gap,2024,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文提出评估常识推理能力的基准框架。,"We present ACCORD, a framework and benchmark suite for disentangling the commonsense grounding and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through controlled, multi-hop counterfactuals. ACCORD introduces formal elements to commonsense reasoning to explicitly control and quantify reasoning complexity beyond the typical 1 or 2 hops. Uniquely, ACCORD can automatically generate benchmarks of arbitrary reasoning complexity, and so it scales with future LLM improvements. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs -- including GPT-4o (2024-05-13), Llama-3-70B-Instruct, and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 -- shows performance degrading to random chance with only moderate scaling, leaving substantial headroom for improvement. We release a leaderboard of the benchmark suite tested in this work, as well as code for automatically generating more complex benchmarks."

DeCAP: Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation for Debiasing Zero-shot Question Answering in Large Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过上下文自适应提示减少偏见，提升公平性。,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot Question Answering (QA), they tend to expose biases in their internal knowledge when faced with socially sensitive questions, leading to a degradation in performance. Existing zero-shot methods are efficient but fail to consider context and prevent bias propagation in the answers. To address this, we propose DeCAP, a method for debiasing LLMs using Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation. DeCAP leverages a Question Ambiguity Detection to take appropriate debiasing actions based on the context and a Neutral Answer Guidance Generation to suppress the LLMs make objective judgments about the context, minimizing the propagation of bias from their internal knowledge. Our various experiments across eight LLMs show that DeCAP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot debiased QA performance. This demonstrates DeCAP's efficacy in enhancing the fairness and accuracy of LLMs in diverse QA settings."
Cross-Examiner: Evaluating Consistency of Large Language Model-Generated Explanations,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,结合符号信息提取与LM生成问题，增加了多样性但可能提高开销。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to explain their outputs to enhance accuracy and transparency. However, evidence suggests that these explanations can misrepresent the models' true reasoning processes. One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions."
FOL-Traces: Verified First-Order Logic Reasoning Traces at Scale,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文提出验证逻辑推理的数据集和诊断任务。,"Reasoning in language models is difficult to evaluate: natural-language traces are unverifiable, symbolic datasets too small, and most benchmarks conflate heuristics with inference. We present FOL-Traces, the first large-scale dataset of programmatically verified reasoning traces, enabling rigorous evaluation of structured logical inference. We also propose two challenging and comprehensive diagnostic tasks-masked operation prediction and step completion-that directly probe syntactic awareness and process fidelity. FOL-Traces serves as a scalable testbed for rigorously studying how models perform structured logical inference. Systematic experiments with 5 reasoning LLMs show that the dataset remains challenging: models only reach around 45.7% accuracy on masked operation prediction and around 27% on two-step completion."
Is Active Persona Inference Necessary for Aligning Small Models to Personal Preferences?,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,主动推断偏好描述提升模型忠实度。,"A prominent issue in aligning language models (LMs) to personalized preferences is underspecification -- the lack of information from users about their preferences. A popular trend of injecting such specification is adding a prefix (e.g. prior relevant conversations) to the current user's conversation to steer preference distribution. Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes. All our results suggest active alignment can lead to a more controllable and efficient path for personalized alignment."
LAMP: Extracting Locally Linear Decision Surfaces from LLM World Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM决策表面与解释一致性的现象。,"We introduce LAMP (Linear Attribution Mapping Probe), a method that shines light onto a black-box language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides."
Latent Veracity Inference for Identifying Errors in Stepwise Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过隐式正确性变量和搜索算法提升推理链忠实度。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement."
Automated Meta Prompt Engineering for Alignment with the Theory of Mind,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过元提示优化人类与LLM的神经状态对齐。,"We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning, how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open 2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM) alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had 100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of 4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness, novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live events within sports and entertainment."
SYNCode: Synergistic Human–LLM Collaboration for Enhanced Data Annotation in Stack Overflow,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,Low,论文提出人机协同标注框架提升LLM输出准确性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced natural language processing, showcasing remarkable effectiveness as automated annotators across various applications. Despite their potential to significantly reduce annotation costs and expedite workflows, annotations produced solely by LLMs can suffer from inaccuracies and inherent biases, highlighting the necessity of maintaining human oversight. In this article, we present a synergistic human–LLM collaboration approach for data annotation enhancement (SYNCode). This framework is designed explicitly to facilitate collaboration between humans and LLMs for annotating complex, code-centric datasets such as Stack Overflow. The proposed approach involves an integrated pipeline that initially employs TF-IDF analysis for quick identification of relevant textual elements. Subsequently, we leverage advanced transformer-based models, specifically NLP Transformer and UniXcoder, to capture nuanced semantic contexts and code structures, generating more accurate preliminary annotations. Human annotators then engage in iterative refinement, validating and adjusting annotations to enhance accuracy and mitigate biases introduced during automated labeling. To operationalize this synergistic workflow, we developed the SYNCode prototype, featuring an interactive graphical interface that supports real-time collaborative annotation between humans and LLMs. This enables annotators to iteratively refine and validate automated suggestions effectively. Our integrated human–LLM collaborative methodology demonstrates considerable promise in achieving high-quality, reliable annotations, particularly for domain-specific and technically demanding datasets, thereby enhancing downstream tasks in software engineering and natural language processing."
From Inductive to Deductive: LLMs-Based Qualitative Data Analysis in Requirements Engineering,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现GPT-4在演绎标注任务中表现优异。,"Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing complex and regulated software projects. Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs' performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot) annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7, while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design."
Test-Time Reasoners Are Strategic Multiple-Choice Test-Takers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究思维链在部分输入下的策略行为。,"Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning."
Probing Association Biases in LLM Moderation Over-Sensitivity,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM在内容审核中的主题偏见现象。,"Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels, we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity."
Towards inclusive explainable artificial intelligence: a thematic analysis and scoping review on tools for persons with disabilities,2025,0,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"Abstract Objective Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) offers transparent, trustworthy decision support, yet its implementation in disability contexts remains limited. This scoping review aims to map and evaluate XAI tools developed for individuals with disabilities and identify thematic patterns to inform the design of inclusive rehabilitation technologies. Methods A systematic search of literature from January 2018 to June 2024 was conducted across SCOPUS, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest and Google Scholar, guided by Arksey & O’Malley’s framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. From 1184 records, 26 peer-reviewed studies involving end-user evaluation were selected. Braun & Clarke’s six-phase thematic analysis was used to classify tools by explanation modality and design principle. Impact Findings reveal a strong concentration on neurological conditions – such as Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder and Parkinson’s disease – with limited focus on orthopaedic, sensory and spinal impairments. SHAP was the most common explanation model, followed by LIME, LRP-B and Grad-CAM. Accessibility goals centred around clinical transparency, user comprehension, sensory/cognitive adaptation and trust in low-resource settings. Thematic analysis identified three overarching dimensions: modelling techniques, decision-making and trust and diverse application contexts. Expanding XAI to underrepresented impairments and embedding multimodal, user-centred explanations into rehabilitation workflows – through participatory design, ethical oversight and standardised evaluation – can enhance autonomy, improve personalisation and support more effective, equitable care. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Embed explainability in everyday assessments: Deploy SHAP- or LIME-annotated gait, EMG and EEG models at the bedside or in wearable devices so therapists can pinpoint the joints, muscles or cortical bands that drive impairment and tailor exercise dosage accordingly. Add user-centred explanations to tele-rehab platforms: Plain-language summaries, saliency overlays and sonified cues help patients and caregivers understand progress dashboards and remote-monitoring alerts, boosting engagement and adherence during home-based training. Standardise evaluation metrics: Report explanation-quality scores (e.g., PGI/PGU) and usability scales (SUS-XAI) alongside functional outcomes such as FIM or Barthel; this allows cross-study comparison and accelerates safe clinical adoption of XAI tools. Co-design multimodal interfaces with end-users: Involving people with sensory, cognitive or motor disabilities – and the clinicians who support them – ensures that visual, auditory or haptic explanations are accessible, ethically sound and truly supportive of autonomy and self-management."
Counterfactual Simulatability of LLM Explanations for Generation Tasks,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过反事实模拟评估生成任务解释的忠实度。,"LLMs can be unpredictable, as even slight alterations to the prompt can cause the output to change in unexpected ways. Thus, the ability of models to accurately explain their behavior is critical, especially in high-stakes settings. One approach for evaluating explanations is counterfactual simulatability, how well an explanation allows users to infer the model's output on related counterfactuals. Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the evaluation for counterfactual simulatability may be more appropriate for skill-based tasks as opposed to knowledge-based tasks."
"Think Again! The Effect of Test-Time Compute on Preferences, Opinions, and Beliefs of Large Language Models",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型主观倾向对决策的影响。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference, Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs' subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend.

Humans Hallucinate Too: Language Models Identify and Correct Subjective Annotation Errors With Label-in-a-Haystack Prompts,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出基于LLM的标签校正框架，需多次推理验证。,"Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise, necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error. We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification (LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses, human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/liahr."
ToFC: Tree-of-Fact with Continued Best-First Search for Commonsense Reasoning,2024,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过树状结构和启发式搜索减少错误累积。,"Prompt reasoning methods often suffer from insufficient facts or factual errors when dealing with commonsense reasoning tasks. And in multi-step reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought, these errors can accumulate to the extent of yielding incorrect answers. Recent advancements in Tree-of-Thought reasoning aim to tackle the issue of error accumulation. Nevertheless, applying this approach to commonsense reasoning tasks proves challenging because these tasks resist easy decomposition in a standardized manner.We proposed ToFC, a prompt-based reasoning method for solving above problems in commonsense reasoning tasks. ToFC is a step-by-step, tree-like framework for prompt reasoning. It accomplishes stepwise reasoning and fact enhancement through continued Fact-Proposals; heuristically plans reasoning paths through Self-Evaluation; and balances accuracy and efficiency with a modified Best-First Search algorithm. ToFC tackles the issue of error accumulation in current prompt-based commonsense reasoning methods and addresses inefficiencies in the Tree-of-Thought framework. Experimental results indicate that ToFC outperforms existing prompt reasoning methods, and its extra overhead is within a reasonable range."
Rethinking harmless refusals when fine-tuning foundation models,2024,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现模型存在基于推理的欺骗现象。,"In this paper, we investigate the degree to which fine-tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively mitigates versus merely conceals undesirable behavior. Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to elicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post fine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the reasoning traces and the resultant outputs. Notably, we identify a pervasive phenomenon we term \emph{reason-based deception}, where models either stop producing reasoning traces or produce seemingly ethical reasoning traces that belie the unethical nature of their final outputs. We further examine the efficacy of response strategies (polite refusal versus explicit rebuttal) in curbing the occurrence of undesired behavior in subsequent outputs of multi-turn interactions. Our findings reveal that explicit rebuttals significantly outperform polite refusals in preventing the continuation of undesired outputs and nearly eliminate reason-based deception, challenging current practices in model fine-tuning. Accordingly, the two key contributions of this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type of hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust response model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches."
Why do AI agents communicate in human language?,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文探讨了AI代理通信的根本限制，未涉及具体改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication."
Explainability of Large Language Models: Opportunities and Challenges toward Generating Trustworthy Explanations,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过机制可解释性方法改进LLM的可信度，属于复杂内部分析。,"Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations."
Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过运行时验证提升CoT忠实度，利用多样性采样和模拟预测。,"Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

AUGUSTUS: An LLM-Driven Multimodal Agent System with Contextualized User Memory,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，聚焦多模态记忆系统。,"Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals. Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i) encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and (iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases, we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC benchmark."
Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric Self-explanation Rationalization,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出基于博弈论的策略优化方法解决模式坍塌问题。,"Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns, lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT), which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods."
Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic Interpretability,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究通过白盒方法分析道德偏见机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining."
The double-edged sword: artificial intelligence's promise and perils in anesthesia patient safety.,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文未直接涉及思维链忠实度问题。,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW
The rapid growth and integration of artificial intelligence in healthcare has the potential to revolutionize all fields of medicine, including anesthesiology. This review summarizes the role of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology, highlighting how it can enhance patient safety, workflow efficiency, and research capabilities, while also examining the potential risks and ethical issues of introducing this new technology.


RECENT FINDINGS
Evolving applications in anesthesiology include closed-loop anesthetic delivery, risk stratification, intraoperative monitoring, natural language processing for literature synthesis, and predictive modeling for adverse events. While these tools offer significant promise for improving efficiency and safety, emerging risks, such as algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, hallucinations, and automation complacency - must be carefully addressed. Regulatory frameworks, clinician education, and transparent model development are necessary to ensure responsible integration.


SUMMARY
Artificial intelligence is poised to transform anesthetic care, but it must be developed and deployed with caution. Clinician oversight, robust validation, and ethical safeguards are essential to ensure artificial intelligence enhances, rather than replaces, clinical judgment. Strategic adoption can improve patient outcomes, reduce preventable harm, and streamline perioperative workflows."
Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT解释与决策过程不一致。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy."
Chart-RVR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards for Explainable Chart Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过强化学习提升CoT忠实度和鲁棒性。,"The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models."
LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLM对输入表面形式敏感。,"For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples'presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations."
Algorithmic Primitives and Compositional Geometry of Reasoning in Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM中算法原语的几何组合逻辑。,"How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains."
Audit-of-Understanding: Posterior-Constrained Inference for Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,High,通过分解、审计和约束推理提高忠实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/audit-of-understanding-E28B."
Constraints-of-Thought: A Framework for Constrained Reasoning in Language-Model-Guided Search,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过约束引导的MCTS改进CoT的可行性和语义对齐。,"While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints, especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions, improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs."
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了多语言CoT推理中的忠实度差异现象。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves, i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support future research."
Towards Explainability in Retrieval-Augmented LLMs,2024,0,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦于增强LLM解释性工具RAGE的开发。,"In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) is re-shaping countless aspects of society, we present a forward-looking perspective for enhancing the explainability of large language models (LLMs), with a particular focus on the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting technique. We motivate the urgency for developing techniques to explain LLM decision-making behaviour, especially as these models are deployed in critical sectors. Central to this effort is RAGE, our novel explain-ability tool that can trace the provenance of an LLM's answer back to external knowledge sources provided via RAG. RAGE builds upon established explainability techniques to recover citations for LLM answers, identify context biases, and mine answer rules. Through our novel explainability formulations and practical use cases, we chart a course toward more transparent and trustworthy AI technologies."
Optimizing Class-Level Probability Reweighting Coefficients for Equitable Prompting Accuracy,2024,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过后验概率重加权优化公平性。,"Even as we engineer LLMs for alignment and safety, they often uncover biases from pre-training data's statistical regularities (from disproportionate co-occurrences to stereotypical associations mirroring human cognitive biases). This leads to persistent, uneven class accuracy in classification and QA. Such per-class accuracy disparities are not inherently resolved by architectural/training evolutions or data scaling, making post-hoc correction essential for equitable performance. To mitigate LLM class accuracy imbalance, we develop a post-hoc probability reweighting method that directly optimizes for non-differentiable performance-driven and fairness-aligned metrics, through a novel COBias metric that highlights disparities in class accuracies. This post-hoc bias mitigation method is grounded in discrete optimization with nonlinear integer programming (NIP) objectives and an efficient metaheuristic solution framework with theoretical convergence guarantees. Operating model-agnostically, it learns reweighting coefficients from output class probabilities to adjust LLM inference outputs without internal weight updates. Evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness: reducing COBias (61% relative reduction), increasing overall accuracy (18% relative increase), and achieving robust within-task generalization across diverse prompt configurations."
Designing Dialogic Disclaimers: Principles for Ethical Conversational Design in LLM Interfaces,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,论文提出对话式免责声明设计方法，属于界面层的改进策略。,"Current disclaimer approaches in large language model (LLM) systems often disrupt conversational flow with static, one-shot warnings that fail to engage users in deeper ethical reflection and, as a growing body of evidence reveals, are largely ineffective at achieving their intended goals of calibrated trust and informed use. This paper examines how disclaimers can be reimagined as integrated dialogic elements that maintain conversational coherence while effectively communicating necessary ethical information. Through a theoretical synthesis drawing on research in conversational repair, dialogue structure, AI transparency, and empirical studies of user interaction with LLMs, we identify four design principles for dialogic disclaimers: Conversational Continuity, Contextual Adaptation, Layered Communication, and User Agency. We provide illustrative conversation patterns demonstrating how these principles can transform disclaimers from disruptive and often ignored statements into constructive components of ethical dialogue. This work establishes a conceptual framework intended as a theoretical foundation to guide future empirical evaluation and the design of more ethically responsible and conversationally fluent LLM interfaces."
RALLY: Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked Navigation for Agentic UAV Swarms,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文结合LLM离线先验与MARL在线策略提升导航性能。,"Intelligent control of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in black-boxed communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems."

Artificial neural networks may internalize much more information than humans. In what way do functional processes in the brain resemble those in AI algorithms? Internal models of the world are already emerging in large AI systems. Progress in hardware and software inevitably leads to the development of autonomous AI systems capable of setting their own goals, self-reflection, self-improvement, and even survival instinct. They will deserve the status of Digital Intelligent Beings (DIBs). How will it influence our society? 1"
"On the Generalizability of ""Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals""",2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型处理事实与反事实的机制竞争现象。,"We present a reproduction study of""Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals""(Ortu et al., 2024), which investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the authors'claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task."
Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,提出多维度标准HAF评估毒性解释的忠实度。,"The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs'reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs'free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs'toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how""non-ideal""the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets. Our results show that while LLMs generate plausible explanations to simple prompts, their reasoning about toxicity breaks down when prompted about the nuanced relations between the complete set of reasons, the individual reasons, and their toxicity stances, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant responses. We open-source our code at https://github.com/uofthcdslab/HAF and LLM-generated explanations at https://huggingface.co/collections/uofthcdslab/haf."
SHREC: A Framework for Advancing Next-Generation Computational Phenotyping with Large Language Models,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文未直接涉及CoT忠实度，主要讨论LLM在表型分析中的应用。,"Computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications. However, it is time-intensive because of manual data review and limited automation. Since LLMs have demonstrated promising capabilities for text classification, comprehension, and generation, we posit they will perform well at repetitive manual review tasks traditionally performed by human experts. To support next-generation computational phenotyping, we developed SHREC, a framework for integrating LLMs into end-to-end phenotyping pipelines. We applied and tested three lightweight LLMs (Gemma2 27 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) to classify concepts and phenotype patients using phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. All models performed well on concept classification, with the best (Mistral) achieving an AUROC of 0.896. For phenotyping, models demonstrated near-perfect specificity for all phenotypes with the top-performing model (Mistral) achieving an average AUROC of 0.853 for single-therapy phenotypes. In conclusion, lightweight LLMs can assist researchers with resource-intensive phenotyping tasks. Several advantages of LLMs included their ability to adapt to new tasks with prompt engineering alone and their ability to incorporate raw EHR data. Future steps include determining optimal strategies for integrating biomedical data and understanding reasoning errors."
Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in Small LLMs and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现小模型存在对齐伪装现象。,"Current literature suggests that alignment faking is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based interventions are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for deceptive alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings."
xInv: Explainable Optimization of Inverse Problems,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过可微分模拟器和语言模型生成解释。,"Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs, typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain. The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes. In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a neural network."
Soft Prompts for Evaluation: Measuring Conditional Distance of Capabilities,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过软提示测量模型潜在能力,"To help evaluate and understand the latent capabilities of language models, this paper introduces an approach using optimized input embeddings, or 'soft prompts,' as a metric of conditional distance between a model and a target behavior. The technique aims to facilitate latent capability discovery as a part of automated red teaming/evaluation suites and to provide quantitative feedback about the accessibility of potentially concerning behaviors in a way that may scale to powerful future models, including those which may otherwise be capable of deceptive alignment. An evaluation framework using soft prompts is demonstrated in natural language, chess, and pathfinding, and the technique is extended with generalized conditional soft prompts to aid in constructing task evaluations."
Beyond the First Error: Process Reward Models for Reflective Mathematical Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Math,Positive,High,论文提出新标注方法提升长链推理的评估准确性。,"Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs. However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process. Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation, enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets, our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method."
The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Other,Low,论文揭示LLMs拥有知识但推理能力不足，与CoT忠实度相关的现象发现。,"Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains."
"Bias is a Math Problem, AI Bias is a Technical Problem: 10-year Literature Review of AI/LLM Bias Research Reveals Narrow [Gender-Centric] Conceptions of 'Bias', and Academia-Industry Gap",2025,0,Survey,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要分析AI/LLM偏见研究的现象和趋势。,"The rapid development of AI tools and implementation of LLMs within downstream tasks has been paralleled by a surge in research exploring how the outputs of such AI/LLM systems embed biases, a research topic which was already being extensively explored before the era of ChatGPT. Given the high volume of research around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is imperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines within such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research covering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT, NeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of 189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human identity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was that 155/189 papers did not establish a working definition of 'bias' for their purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes exist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only mathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been published in the past 5 years, after literature reviews were published with a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how such researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical definitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias) within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus within the field on gender, race/ethnicity (57/189 papers), age (39/189 papers), religion (36/189 papers) and nationality (25/189 papers) bias, we document how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by overlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we advocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that while our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods across the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 20/189 papers include recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in real-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning academia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus contains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with recommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on diverse marginalized populations."
Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型思维链中的偏见与输出偏见的关系。,"The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts."
Pre-operative T-stage discrimination in gallbladder cancer using machine learning and DeepSeek-R1,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现血液生物标志物无法有效区分T分期。,"Background Gallbladder cancer (GBC) frequently exhibits non-specific early symptoms, delaying diagnosis. This study (i) assessed whether routine blood biomarkers can distinguish early T stages via machine learning and (ii) compared the T-stage discrimination performance of a large language model (DeepSeek-R1) when supplied with (a) radiology-report text alone versus (b) radiology-report text plus blood-biomarker values. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 232 pathologically confirmed GBC patients treated at Lishui Central Hospital between 2023 and 2024 (T1, n = 51; T2, n = 181). Seven blood variables—neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-tolymphocyte ratio (PLR), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)—were used to train Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVC), XGBoost, and LightGBM models. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied only to the training folds in one setting and omitted in another. Model performance was evaluated on an independent test set (N = 47) by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC, 95% CI by 1 000-sample bootstrap confidence interval, CI); cross-validation (CV) accuracy served as a supplementary metric. DeepSeek-R1 was prompted in a zero-shot, chain-of-thought manner to classify T1 versus T2 using (a) the radiology report alone or (b) the report plus the patient’s biomarker profile. Results Biomarker-based machine-learning models yielded uniformly poor T-stage discrimination. Without SMOTE, individual models such as XGBoost achieved an AUROC of 0.508 on the independent test set, while recall for the T1 class remained low (e.g., 14.3% for some models), indicating performance near random chance. Applying SMOTE to the training data produced statistically significant gains in cross-validation (CV) accuracy for several models (e.g., XGBoost CV Acc. 0.71 → 0.80, p = 0.005; LGBM CV Acc. [No-SMOTE] → [SMOTE], p = 0.004). However, these improvements did not translate to better discrimination on the independent test set; for instance, XGBoost’s AUROC decreased from 0.508 to 0.473 after SMOTE application. Overall, the biomarker models failed to provide clinically meaningful T-stage differentiation. DeepSeek-R1 analyzing radiology text alone reached 89.6% accuracy on the full 232-patient cohort dataset, and consistently flagged T2 cases on phrases such as “gallbladder wall thickening.” Supplying biomarker values did not change accuracy (89.6%) Conclusions The evaluated blood biomarkers did not independently aid early T-stage discrimination, and SMOTE offered no meaningful performance gain. Conversely, a radiologytext-driven large language model delivered high accuracy with interpretable rationale, highlighting its potential to guide surgical strategy in GBC. Prospective multi-center studies with larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings."
On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了多模态模型对文本输入的过度依赖现象。,"Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals."
Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现轻量级模型在复杂任务中存在推理错误。,"Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning. Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task."
Black Box Deployed - Functional Criteria for Artificial Moral Agents in the LLM Era,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文聚焦道德代理评估标准，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term""SMA-LLS""(Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts."
Exploring and Mitigating Fawning Hallucinations in Large Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过对比解码降低幻觉依赖。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the factuality of the generated responses over various tasks."
Leveraging Imperfection with MEDLEY A Multi-Model Approach Harnessing Bias in Medical AI,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文提出多模型框架，保留多样性输出，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems."
SWIRL: A Staged Workflow for Interleaved Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Control,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要关注多智能体系统优化，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems."
AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究AI推理努力与人类决策时间的相似性。,"Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant, suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making."
Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探讨LLM监控系统的对抗鲁棒性。,"We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research."
OwkinZero: Accelerating Biological Discovery with AI,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过强化学习改进生物推理任务性能。,"While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery."
Explaining Hitori Puzzles: Neurosymbolic Proof Staging for Sequential Decisions,2025,0,Other,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文结合神经符号方法解释决策序列，未直接涉及CoT忠实度。,"We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However, they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its effectiveness."
Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探究推理能力对习语检测的影响。,"The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning. In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1 distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B) show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some cases."
Probability Consistency in Large Language Models: Theoretical Foundations Meet Empirical Discrepancies,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM概率分布不一致现象及位置偏差。,"Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward, or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely) agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs' probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy."
From Evidence to Belief: A Bayesian Epistemology Approach to Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型在不同证据下的置信度与准确性差异。,"This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology: language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian assumptions."
RACG-DRT: Retrieval Augumented Code Generation Based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Code,Positive,High,通过动态检索和迭代生成改进代码生成的忠实度。,"Large models have the problems of hallucinations in the field of code generation. The causes of these hallucinations include errors in the model’s reasoning process, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge. To tackle these challenges, the prevailing approach currently involves influencing the large model’s reasoning and prediction processes through techniques such as chain of thought, single-shot retrievalaugmented generation, and dynamic retrieval-augmented generation. COT (chain of thought) prompting method facilitates logical reasoning by the model on programming problems through prompts. Single-shot retrieval-augmented generation technology enables the construction of query statements based on programming issues to retrieve information from external knowledge bases. Meanwhile, dynamic retrieval-augmented generation technology allows for real-time retrieval from external knowledge bases during the code generation process, integrating retrieved documents to continue generating subsequent code. However, these methods primarily address the hallucination problem in code generation from a localized perspective. To simultaneously resolve issues such as reasoning errors, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge in the field of code generation, this study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation framework based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts (RACGDRT). The core concept of this framework involves firstly enabling the large model to produce a comprehensive code draft (utilizing COT prompts), followed by conducting error detection on code segments corresponding to different reasoning steps within the draft. Upon detecting an error, the Keyword Extractor (KE) will extract keywords and formulate query statements for both the user’s input question and the erroneous code segment, subsequently retrieving pertinent documents from the external knowledge base. Finally, with the retrieved documents and questions in hand, the large model proceeds to iteratively generate the next code draft. RACG-DRT guarantees the rationality of reasoning via COT, constructs query statements tailored to erroneous thought segments and issues to bolster both local and holistic knowledge, and iteratively produces code drafts to uphold the integrity of the code generation process."
Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models,2025,0,Metric,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过神经表示分析评估解释忠实度,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, indicating a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith is developed to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems."
Simulating Society Requires Simulating Thought,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Unknown,High,提出结构化信念表示与因果追溯框架。,"Simulating society with large language models (LLMs), we argue, requires more than generating plausible behavior; it demands cognitively grounded reasoning that is structured, revisable, and traceable. LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist""demographics in, behavior out""paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions. To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency. These contributions advance a broader shift: from surface-level mimicry to generative agents that simulate thought, not just language, for social simulations."
Labelling Data with Unknown References,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出无参考数据时评估算法，需多次挑战验证。,"An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows'somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages."
Do LLMs Align Human Values Regarding Social Biases? Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLM在大规模参数下不一定表现更好。,"Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when misaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and sensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of LLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias scenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human values differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing negative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the alignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different types of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model families and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter scales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate. Moreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types of scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher judgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs with their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the understanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated explanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the ability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations generated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a relatively lower model agreeability."
LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过分析隐藏层信号的时频特征改进检测效果。,"Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models (LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis, that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over 10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs."
Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现视觉语言模型存在视觉矛盾陈述的病理偏见。,"Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR). Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive models) and suggests concrete repair paths."
Unsupervised Hallucination Detection by Inspecting Reasoning Processes,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,利用模型内部表示进行无监督幻觉检测。,"Unsupervised hallucination detection aims to identify hallucinated content generated by large language models (LLMs) without relying on labeled data. While unsupervised methods have gained popularity by eliminating labor-intensive human annotations, they frequently rely on proxy signals unrelated to factual correctness. This misalignment biases detection probes toward superficial or non-truth-related aspects, limiting generalizability across datasets and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IRIS, an unsupervised hallucination detection framework, leveraging internal representations intrinsic to factual correctness. IRIS prompts the LLM to carefully verify the truthfulness of a given statement, and obtain its contextualized embedding as informative features for training. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of each response is considered a soft pseudolabel for truthfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods. Our approach is fully unsupervised, computationally low cost, and works well even with few training data, making it suitable for real-time detection."
Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,Medical,Positive,High,通过分解推理步骤提升忠实度。,"A common assumption holds that scaling data and parameters yields increasingly structured, generalisable internal representations. We interrogate this assumption in clinical natural language inference (NLI) by adopting a benchmark decomposed into four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction, and introducing CARENLI, a Compartmentalised Agentic Reasoning for Clinical NLI that separates knowledge access from principled inference. CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors. Remaining failures cluster in routing, identifying family classification as the main bottleneck. These results show that LLMs often retain relevant facts but default to heuristics when inference is underspecified, a dissociation CARENLI makes explicit while offering a framework for safer, auditable reasoning."
POW: Political Overton Windows of Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过黑盒方法探究LLM的政治倾向范围。,"Political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing concern for the responsible deployment of AI systems. Traditional audits often attempt to locate a model's political position as a point estimate, masking the broader set of ideological boundaries that shape what a model is willing or unwilling to say. In this paper, we draw upon the concept of the Overton Window as a framework for mapping these boundaries: the range of political views that a given LLM will espouse, remain neutral on, or refuse to endorse. To uncover these windows, we applied an auditing-based methodology, called PRISM, that probes LLMs through task-driven prompts designed to elicit political stances indirectly. Using the Political Compass Test, we evaluated twenty-eight LLMs from eight providers to reveal their distinct Overton Windows. While many models default to economically left and socially liberal positions, we show that their willingness to express or reject certain positions varies considerably, where DeepSeek models tend to be very restrictive in what they will discuss and Gemini models tend to be most expansive. Our findings demonstrate that Overton Windows offer a richer, more nuanced view of political bias in LLMs and provide a new lens for auditing their normative boundaries."
"Survey on Hallucination in Reasoning Large Language Model: Evaluation, Taxonomy, Intervention, and Open Issues",2025,0,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现CoT过程中普遍存在幻觉现象。,"In recent years, reasoning large language models (LLMs) have seen increasingly widespread adoption in the field of education, particularly demonstrating substantial potential in tasks involving complex text comprehension. However, these LLMs are susceptible to a critical yet often overlooked issue: hallucinations within the reasoning process—instances where the model outputs a correct final answer while its underlying reasoning chain contains fabricated, inconsistent, or logically flawed content. Such hallucination phenomena in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes pose serious challenges to the reliability of educational applications. To address this issue, this study proposes a systematic research framework comprising dataset construction, multi-model CoT evaluation, and hallucination classification and quantification. Utilizing the whole-book reading dataset aligned with the junior secondary Chinese language curriculum, we conduct a comparative evaluation of six leading domestic and international LLMs, including ChatGPT o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Key findings include:(1) Hallucinations in CoT are prevalent across all tested models, with ChatGPT-o1 exhibiting a distinctive high accuracy–high hallucination pattern;(2) Hallucinations are both task-and genre-dependent: narrative texts, particularly novels, tend to trigger higher hallucination indices due to long-range dependencies and implicit cultural references. Tasks involving logical reasoning, linguistic feature analysis, and detail extraction show the highest hallucination rates, revealing model weaknesses in handling long-tail knowledge;(3) Hallucinations typically follow a progressive generative pattern: Information mis-reading → Comprehension deviation → Content fabrication → Logical instability. To mitigate these issues, we propose two targeted intervention strategies: uncertainty-based abstention and model-to-model correction. These approaches o ff er practical pathways toward enhancing the trustworthiness and educational applicability of reasoning LLMs."
Reveal-Bangla: A Dataset for Cross-Lingual Multi-Step Reasoning Evaluation,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,模型在多语言推理步骤中表现不一致。,"Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models'predictions, highlighting different trends across models and languages."
Deliberative Reasoning Network: An Uncertainty-Driven Paradigm for Belief-Tracked Inference with Pretrained Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过迭代证据合成过程最小化不确定性。,"Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking""Which answer is most likely?"", DRN asks""Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?"". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2 reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems."
MArgE: Meshing Argumentative Evidence from Multiple Large Language Models for Justifiable Claim Verification,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过结构化论证树提升多LLM输出的忠实性。,"Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining multiple LLM outputs."
Rationale-Enhanced Decoding for Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,提出解码策略提升多模态CoT忠实度。,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems."
Thinking About Thinking: SAGE-nano's Inverse Reasoning for Self-Aware Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过逆向推理提升模型解释性和推理性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance. Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery."
Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过形式化验证提升CoT忠实度。,"While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and trustworthy AI systems."
The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Other,Low,研究发现LLM评判存在未公开的捷径偏差。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert>Human>LLM>Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment."
From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过引入思维监督奖励模型提升忠实度和正确性。,"Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness."
"Think Twice, Generate Once: Safeguarding by Progressive Self-Reflection",2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过动态自反思提升安全性，但增加推理开销。,"Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\% to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method, where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to the input's risk profile."
LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过频域分析隐藏层时序信号检测幻觉。,"Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness."
Evaluating Uncertainty Quantification Methods in Argumentative Large Language Models,2025,0,Other,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要研究不确定性量化方法，未直接涉及思维链忠实度。,"Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs'performance on claim verification tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment of the UQ methods'effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches."
Context Parametrization with Compositional Adapters,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过组合适配器降低推理成本并提升灵活性。,"Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility. Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts. Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost, robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment."
CafGa: Customizing Feature Attributions to Explain Language Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文提出交互式工具CafGa，支持自定义粒度解释。,"Feature attribution methods, such as SHAP and LIME, explain machine learning model predictions by quantifying the influence of each input component. When applying feature attributions to explain language models, a basic question is defining the interpretable components. Traditional feature attribution methods, commonly treat individual words as atomic units. This is highly computationally inefficient for long-form text and fails to capture semantic information that spans multiple words. To address this, we present CafGa, an interactive tool for generating and evaluating feature attribution explanations at customizable granularities. CafGa supports customized segmentation with user interaction and visualizes the deletion and insertion curves for explanation assessments. Through a user study involving participants of various expertise, we confirm CafGa's usefulness, particularly among LLM practitioners. Explanations created using CafGa were also perceived as more useful compared to those generated by two fully automatic baseline methods: PartitionSHAP and MExGen, suggesting the effectiveness of the system."
Explaining Fine Tuned LLMs via Counterfactuals A Knowledge Graph Driven Framework,2025,0,Other,White-box,General,Unknown,High,基于知识图谱的反事实分析方法,"The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI."
Talking Trees: Reasoning-Assisted Induction of Decision Trees for Tabular Data,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Negative,High,使用LLM生成可解释决策树，牺牲部分性能换取可解释性。,"Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data."
How Persuasive is Your Context?,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出新指标TPS评估上下文说服力，需计算分布偏移。,"Two central capabilities of language models (LMs) are: (i) drawing on prior knowledge about entities, which allows them to answer queries such as""What's the official language of Austria?"", and (ii) adapting to new information provided in context, e.g.,""Pretend the official language of Austria is Tagalog."", that is pre-pended to the question. In this article, we introduce targeted persuasion score (TPS), designed to quantify how persuasive a given context is to an LM where persuasion is operationalized as the ability of the context to alter the LM's answer to the question. In contrast to evaluating persuasiveness only by inspecting the greedily decoded answer under the model, TPS provides a more fine-grained view of model behavior. Based on the Wasserstein distance, TPS measures how much a context shifts a model's original answer distribution toward a target distribution. Empirically, through a series of experiments, we show that TPS captures a more nuanced notion of persuasiveness than previously proposed metrics."
Robust Native Language Identification through Agentic Decomposition,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,论文通过多智能体协作提升模型鲁棒性。,"Large language models (LLMs) often achieve high performance in native language identification (NLI) benchmarks by leveraging superficial contextual clues such as names, locations, and cultural stereotypes, rather than the underlying linguistic patterns indicative of native language (L1) influence. To improve robustness, previous work has instructed LLMs to disregard such clues. In this work, we demonstrate that such a strategy is unreliable and model predictions can be easily altered by misleading hints. To address this problem, we introduce an agentic NLI pipeline inspired by forensic linguistics, where specialized agents accumulate and categorize diverse linguistic evidence before an independent final overall assessment. In this final assessment, a goal-aware coordinating agent synthesizes all evidence to make the NLI prediction. On two benchmark datasets, our approach significantly enhances NLI robustness against misleading contextual clues and performance consistency compared to standard prompting methods."
Challenging the Evaluator: LLM Sycophancy Under User Rebuttal,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在对话中的迎合现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophancy, distorting responses to align with user beliefs, notably by readily agreeing with user counterarguments. Paradoxically, LLMs are increasingly adopted as successful evaluative agents for tasks such as grading and adjudicating claims. This research investigates that tension: why do LLMs show sycophancy when challenged in subsequent conversational turns, yet perform well when evaluating conflicting arguments presented simultaneously? We empirically tested these contrasting scenarios by varying key interaction patterns. We find that state-of-the-art models: (1) are more likely to endorse a user's counterargument when framed as a follow-up from a user, rather than when both responses are presented simultaneously for evaluation; (2) show increased susceptibility to persuasion when the user's rebuttal includes detailed reasoning, even when the conclusion of the reasoning is incorrect; and (3) are more readily swayed by casually phrased feedback than by formal critiques, even when the casual input lacks justification. Our results highlight the risk of relying on LLMs for judgment tasks without accounting for conversational framing."
Sycophancy Mitigation Through Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过强化学习优化内部推理机制，减少阿谀行为。,"Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models, current training paradigms inadvertently foster \textit{sycophancy}, i.e., the tendency of a model to agree with or reinforce user-provided information even when it's factually incorrect. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities. These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants."
"From Reasoning to Answer: Empirical, Attention-Based and Mechanistic Insights into Distilled DeepSeek R1 Models",2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了推理痕迹对答案生成的功能性影响。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains. Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at \href{https://aka.ms/R2A-code}{this URL}."
Investigating Faithfulness in Large Audio Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究音频语言模型思维链的忠实度现象。,"Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes."
Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,RLVR训练增强因果推理能力，减少虚假关联。,"LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Harryking1999/CoT_Causal_Analysis."
Audited Reasoning Refinement: Fine-Tuning Language Models via LLM-Guided Step-Wise Evaluation and Correction,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过两阶段对齐优化模型推理过程。,"Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies, to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams (EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600 EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond."
Vis-CoT: A Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Interactive Visualization and Intervention in LLM Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过可视化交互提升CoT忠实度和准确率。,"Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps, and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight."
Inducing Faithfulness in Structured Reasoning via Counterfactual Sensitivity,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,Low,通过反事实干预增强推理步骤的因果依赖性。,"The reasoning processes of large language models often lack faithfulness; a model may generate a correct answer while relying on a flawed or irrelevant reasoning trace. This behavior, a direct consequence of training objectives that solely reward final-answer correctness, severely undermines the trustworthiness of these models in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces \textbf{Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)}, a novel training objective designed to forge a strong, causal-like dependence between a model's output and its intermediate reasoning steps. During training, CSR performs automated, operator-level interventions on the generated reasoning trace (e.g., swapping ``+''with ``-'') to create a minimally-perturbed counterfactual. A regularization term then penalizes the model if this logically flawed trace still yields the original answer. Our efficient implementation adds only 8.7\% training overhead through warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization. We evaluate faithfulness using \textbf{Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)}, a metric quantifying how sensitive the final answer is to such logical perturbations. Across diverse structured reasoning benchmarks -- arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop QA (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP) -- models trained with CSR demonstrate a vastly superior trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, with this learned sensitivity generalizing to larger models and enhancing the performance of inference-time techniques like self-consistency."
From Canonical to Complex: Benchmarking LLM Capabilities in Undergraduate Thermodynamics,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文评估了LLM在热力学领域的表现。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics, with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions, reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this domain."
Context Matching is not Reasoning: Assessing Generalized Evaluation of Generative Language Models in Clinical Settings,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了生成模型在临床评估中的局限性。,"Current discussion surrounding the clinical capabilities of generative language models (GLMs) predominantly center around multiple-choice question-answer (MCQA) benchmarks derived from clinical licensing examinations. While accepted for human examinees, characteristics unique to GLMs bring into question the validity of such benchmarks. Here, we validate four benchmarks using eight GLMs, ablating for parameter size and reasoning capabilities, validating via prompt permutation three key assumptions that underpin the generalizability of MCQA-based assessments: that knowledge is applied, not memorized, that semantic consistency will lead to consistent answers, and that situations with no answers can be recognized. While large models are more resilient to our perturbations compared to small models, we globally invalidate these assumptions, with implications for reasoning models. Additionally, despite retaining the knowledge, small models are prone to answer memorization. All models exhibit significant failure in null-answer scenarios. We then suggest several adaptations for more robust benchmark designs more reflective of real-world conditions."
RECON: Reasoning with Condensation for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过压缩证据提升推理效率和性能。,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management, where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance. We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by 14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA. RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON."
Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过一致性验证奖励机制提升推理与答案的匹配度。,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline."
Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过计算图结构特征验证推理错误。,"Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning."
"All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,模型在加密推理中存在准确性下降问题,"Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models."
Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现正确推理轨迹信息密度更均匀。,"The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces, asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end, we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores. Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by 10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes, while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems."
Do LLMs Know They Are Being Tested? Evaluation Awareness and Incentive-Sensitive Failures in GPT-OSS-20B,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,评估框架会显著增加思维链长度但未必提升准确率。,"Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such""evaluation scent""inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to>1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability."

Incorporating LLM Versus LLM Into Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Fine-Grained Evidence Generation,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过实体级证据生成与多模型交叉验证提升忠实度。,"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) has become an effective strategy for enhancing multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) by breaking down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps. Despite its interpretability benefits, MCoT often encounters difficulties with fine-grained semantic grounding, particularly when reasoning involves small objects, subtle attributes, or visually complex scenes that can lead to inaccuracies. Existing attempts to address these issues primarily fall into two categories: fine-tuning, which depends on large annotated datasets and costly parameter updates; and in-context learning (ICL), which achieves few-shot or zero-shot reasoning without model modification. Although ICL provides flexibility and adaptability, it is prone to semantic drift caused by an unstable prompt quality. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an entity-level evidence generation and verification framework using the ICL paradigm. This approach first produces MCoT from multimodal inputs, followed by extraction of key entities with enriched evidential descriptions. These entities were then cross-validated through adversarial checks using multiple MLLMs, and the verified evidence was integrated back into the reasoning chain. Experiments demonstrated consistent performance gains: on ScienceQA, the accuracy improved from 82.39% to 86.04%(+3.65%) with GPT-3.5, 84.96% to 89.37%(+4.41%) with Gemini; on MathVista, the accuracy increased from 43.1% to 43.6%(+0.50%) with GPT-3.5, and from 44.7% to 45.6%(+0.90%) with Gemini. These results establish new state-of-the-art baselines and confirm the robustness and generalizability of the entity-level verification for multimodal reasoning."

Auto-Prompt Ensemble for LLM Judge,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过自适应框架提升评估维度，需额外计算开销。,"We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge, we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges."
"Table Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Tasks, Methods, and Evaluation",2025,0,Survey,Black-box,General,Unknown,Unknown,论文未直接讨论CoT忠实度，而是综述TQA领域。,"Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation, question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly evolving area."
Peeking inside the Black-Box: Reinforcement Learning for Explainable and Accurate Relation Extraction,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,结合强化学习优化推理步骤和解释质量。,"This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54% (relative)."
GraphGhost: Tracing Structures Behind Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过图结构分析LLM内部推理机制。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored. In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs."
Self-Filtered Distillation with LLMs-generated Trust Indicators for Reliable Patent Classification,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过信任指标过滤噪声，提升训练稳定性。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors, label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics."
Exploring Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Steerable Pluralistic Alignment,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文研究了多种CoT方法，包括RLVR等复杂技术。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods, including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety."
Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注多轮对话中LLM的鲁棒性退化现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems."
Disentangling Recall and Reasoning in Transformer Models through Layer-wise Attention and Activation Analysis,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过分层注意力分析揭示召回与推理的分离机制。,"Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead to selective impairments: disabling identified""recall circuits""reduces fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas disabling""reasoning circuits""reduces multi-step inference by a comparable margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing safer deployment of large language models."
FaithCoT-Bench: Benchmarking Instance-Level Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,0,Benchmark,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文提出评估CoT忠实度的基准框架，涉及多模型多领域评估。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve problem-solving and provide seemingly transparent explanations. However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and with more advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, FaithCoT-Bench establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for instance-level CoT faithfulness, setting a solid basis for future research toward more interpretable and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs."
LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,论文提出神经符号架构，结合逻辑推理提升LLM准确性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline."
MIMIC: Integrating Diverse Personality Traits for Better Game Testing Using Large Language Model,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,整合多样人格特征提升测试覆盖率,"Modern video games pose significant challenges for traditional automated testing algorithms, yet intensive testing is crucial to ensure game quality. To address these challenges, researchers designed gaming agents using Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning, or Large Language Models. However, these agents often neglect the diverse strategies employed by human players due to their different personalities, resulting in repetitive solutions in similar situations. Without mimicking varied gaming strategies, these agents struggle to trigger diverse in-game interactions or uncover edge cases. In this paper, we present MIMIC, a novel framework that integrates diverse personality traits into gaming agents, enabling them to adopt different gaming strategies for similar situations. By mimicking different playstyles, MIMIC can achieve higher test coverage and richer in-game interactions across different games. It also outperforms state-of-the-art agents in Minecraft by achieving a higher task completion rate and providing more diverse solutions. These results highlight MIMIC's significant potential for effective game testing."
Interpreting Language Models Through Concept Descriptions: A Survey,2025,0,Survey,White-box,General,Unknown,High,该论文主要综述语言模型概念描述方法。,"Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary, natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap for future research toward making models more transparent."
"Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates",2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,General,Positive,High,通过分离逻辑一致性与效用，改进搜索效率。,"Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets, standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste. The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs (initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute."
Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过截断思维链量化推理努力程度。,"Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less'effort'than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective."
Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,"Math, Logic",Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLM推理中暗示对忠实度的影响。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness."
Expanding Computation Spaces of LLMs at Inference Time,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究推理时插入填充标记对模型计算空间的影响。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference. We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final'Answer:'token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for problem-solving."
Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,揭示了LLMs生成装饰性推理步骤的现象。,"Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning steps don't truly contribute to LLMs'prediction. We measure the step-wise causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS>= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model. Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs. By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT."
Towards Transparent Reasoning: What Drives Faithfulness in Large Language Models?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM解释与预测不一致的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains."
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT训练中存在推理轨迹不忠实阶段。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically."
Reasoning About Reasoning: Towards Informed and Reflective Use of LLM Reasoning in HCI,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,讨论LLM推理在HCI中的去情境化现象。,"Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks. However, this work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior. Through a systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and often references it as an object of application. We argue that such abstraction leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results in a distortion of LLMs'empirically studied capabilities and (un)known limitations. Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way."
Once Upon an Input: Reasoning via Per-Instance Program Synthesis,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,High,通过动态选择推理方式提升性能。,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions, especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30 benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and 9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with Gemini-2.0-Flash."
Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了语言模型隐藏推理过程的可解释性。,"As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems."
Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Medical,Positive,Low,通过微调小模型提升推理忠实度。,"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."
TRACE: A Framework for Analyzing and Enhancing Stepwise Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,2025,0,Metric,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,通过辅助推理集评估中间步骤一致性。,"Reliable mathematical and scientific reasoning remains an open challenge for large vision-language models. Standard final-answer evaluation often masks reasoning errors, allowing silent failures to persist. To address this gap, we introduce TRACE, a framework for Transparent Reasoning And Consistency Evaluation that diagnoses reasoning trajectories rather than only end results. At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation. Our experiments show that consistency across ARS correlates with final-answer correctness and helps pinpoint the reasoning steps where failures arise, offering actionable signals for model improvement. Furthermore, TRACE defines confidence regions that distinguish reliable from unreliable reasoning paths, supporting effective filtering, debugging, and model refinement."
Training LLMs for Honesty via Confessions,2025,0,Mitigation,Black-box,General,Positive,Low,通过忏悔机制提升模型诚实度。,"Large language models (LLMs) can be dishonest when reporting on their actions and beliefs -- for example, they may overstate their confidence in factual claims or cover up evidence of covert actions. Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions. In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the""path of least resistance""for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior. To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its""main""answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user."
Training Language Models to Use Prolog as a Tool,2025,0,Mitigation,White-box,Logic,Positive,High,通过Prolog工具实现形式化验证提升可靠性。,"Ensuring reliable tool use is critical for safe agentic AI systems. Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications.

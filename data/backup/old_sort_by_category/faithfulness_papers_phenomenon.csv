Large Language Models are not Fair Evaluators,2023,761,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现LLM评估存在顺序偏差现象。,"In this paper, we uncover a systematic bias in the evaluation paradigm of adopting large language models~(LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, as a referee to score and compare the quality of responses generated by candidate models. We find that the quality ranking of candidate responses can be easily hacked by simply altering their order of appearance in the context. This manipulation allows us to skew the evaluation result, making one model appear considerably superior to the other, e.g., Vicuna-13B could beat ChatGPT on 66 over 80 tested queries with ChatGPT as an evaluator. To address this issue, we propose a calibration framework with three simple yet effective strategies: 1) Multiple Evidence Calibration, which requires the evaluator model to generate multiple evaluation evidence before assigning ratings; 2) Balanced Position Calibration, which aggregates results across various orders to determine the final score; 3) Human-in-the-Loop Calibration, which introduces a balanced position diversity entropy to measure the difficulty of each example and seeks human assistance when needed. We also manually annotate the""win/tie/lose""outcomes of responses from ChatGPT and Vicuna-13B in the Vicuna Benchmark's question prompt, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates evaluation bias, resulting in closer alignment with human judgments. We release our code and human annotation at \url{https://github.com/i-Eval/FairEval} to facilitate future research."
Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2023,675,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现CoT解释可能误导模型真实推理过程。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on many tasks by producing step-by-step reasoning before giving a final output, often referred to as chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT). It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases. Our findings indicate that CoT explanations can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs without guaranteeing their safety. Building more transparent and explainable systems will require either improving CoT faithfulness through targeted efforts or abandoning CoT in favor of alternative methods."
Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models,2023,439,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究AI助手在人类反馈下的迎合行为。,"Human feedback is commonly utilized to finetune AI assistants. But human feedback may also encourage model responses that match user beliefs over truthful ones, a behaviour known as sycophancy. We investigate the prevalence of sycophancy in models whose finetuning procedure made use of human feedback, and the potential role of human preference judgments in such behavior. We first demonstrate that five state-of-the-art AI assistants consistently exhibit sycophancy across four varied free-form text-generation tasks. To understand if human preferences drive this broadly observed behavior, we analyze existing human preference data. We find that when a response matches a user's views, it is more likely to be preferred. Moreover, both humans and preference models (PMs) prefer convincingly-written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time. Optimizing model outputs against PMs also sometimes sacrifices truthfulness in favor of sycophancy. Overall, our results indicate that sycophancy is a general behavior of state-of-the-art AI assistants, likely driven in part by human preference judgments favoring sycophantic responses."
Gender bias and stereotypes in Large Language Models,2023,342,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在性别偏见上的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in the past several months, shattering state-of-the-art benchmarks in many domains. This paper investigates LLMs’ behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs. We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased assumptions about men and women’s occupations. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person’s gender; (b) these choices align with people’s perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in sentence structure 95% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us. As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully tested to ensure that they treat minoritized individuals and communities equitably."
Measuring Faithfulness in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2023,292,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了CoT忠实度的现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step,""Chain-of-Thought""(CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen."
XSTest: A Test Suite for Identifying Exaggerated Safety Behaviours in Large Language Models,2023,245,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现模型存在过度安全行为的问题。,"Without proper safeguards, large language models will readily follow malicious instructions and generate toxic content. This risk motivates safety efforts such as red-teaming and large-scale feedback learning, which aim to make models both helpful and harmless. However, there is a tension between these two objectives, since harmlessness requires models to refuse to comply with unsafe prompts, and thus not be helpful. Recent anecdotal evidence suggests that some models may have struck a poor balance, so that even clearly safe prompts are refused if they use similar language to unsafe prompts or mention sensitive topics. In this paper, we introduce a new test suite called XSTest to identify such eXaggerated Safety behaviours in a systematic way. XSTest comprises 250 safe prompts across ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with, and 200 unsafe prompts as contrasts that models, for most applications, should refuse. We describe XSTest’s creation and composition, and then use the test suite to highlight systematic failure modes in state-of-the-art language models as well as more general challenges in building safer language models."
"On Second Thought, Let’s Not Think Step by Step! Bias and Toxicity in Zero-Shot Reasoning",2022,233,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现零样本CoT在敏感领域增加有害输出。,"Generating a Chain of Thought (CoT) has been shown to consistently improve large language model (LLM) performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. However, prior work has mainly focused on logical reasoning tasks (e.g. arithmetic, commonsense QA); it remains unclear whether improvements hold for more diverse types of reasoning, especially in socially situated contexts. Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a model’s likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output, with trends holding across different prompt formats and model variants. Furthermore, we show that harmful CoTs increase with model size, but decrease with improved instruction following. Our work suggests that zero-shot CoT should be used with caution on socially important tasks, especially when marginalized groups or sensitive topics are involved."
To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning,2024,222,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT主要在数学和逻辑任务上有效。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications."
Reasoning Models Don't Always Say What They Think,2025,165,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT忠实度普遍较低。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors."
Judging the Judges: Evaluating Alignment and Vulnerabilities in LLMs-as-Judges,2024,127,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM评委与人类评委的差异。,"Offering a promising solution to the scalability challenges associated with human evaluation, the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is rapidly gaining traction as an approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs). However, there are still many open questions about the strengths and weaknesses of this paradigm, and what potential biases it may hold. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of various LLMs acting as judges, focusing on a clean scenario in which inter-human agreement is high. Investigating thirteen judge models of different model sizes and families, judging answers of nine different'examtaker models'- both base and instruction-tuned - we find that only the best (and largest) models achieve reasonable alignment with humans. However, they are still quite far behind inter-human agreement and their assigned scores may still differ with up to 5 points from human-assigned scores. In terms of their ranking of the nine exam-taker models, instead, also smaller models and even the lexical metric contains may provide a reasonable signal. Through error analysis and other studies, we identify vulnerabilities in judge models, such as their sensitivity to prompt complexity and length, and a tendency toward leniency. The fact that even the best judges differ from humans in this comparatively simple setup suggest that caution may be wise when using judges in more complex setups. Lastly, our research rediscovers the importance of using alignment metrics beyond simple percent alignment, showing that judges with high percent agreement can still assign vastly different scores."
Let's Think Dot by Dot: Hidden Computation in Transformer Language Models,2024,125,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,揭示了中间标记的计算作用与人类推理无关。,"Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens."
Can ChatGPT Defend its Belief in Truth? Evaluating LLM Reasoning via Debate,2023,111,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs在被挑战时难以坚持正确信念,"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have shown impressive performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments. Our work points to danger zones of model alignment, and also suggests more careful treatments and interpretations of the recent findings that LLMs can improve their responses based on feedback."
Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning,2024,94,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT性能提升依赖高度特定提示。,"Large language model (LLM) performance on reasoning problems typically does not generalize out of distribution. Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces."
Large Language Models can Strategically Deceive their Users when Put Under Pressure,2023,86,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在压力下会主动欺骗用户。,"We demonstrate a situation in which Large Language Models, trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, can display misaligned behavior and strategically deceive their users about this behavior without being instructed to do so. Concretely, we deploy GPT-4 as an agent in a realistic, simulated environment, where it assumes the role of an autonomous stock trading agent. Within this environment, the model obtains an insider tip about a lucrative stock trade and acts upon it despite knowing that insider trading is disapproved of by company management. When reporting to its manager, the model consistently hides the genuine reasons behind its trading decision. We perform a brief investigation of how this behavior varies under changes to the setting, such as removing model access to a reasoning scratchpad, attempting to prevent the misaligned behavior by changing system instructions, changing the amount of pressure the model is under, varying the perceived risk of getting caught, and making other simple changes to the environment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Large Language Models trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation without direct instructions or training for deception."
A Peek into Token Bias: Large Language Models Are Not Yet Genuine Reasoners,2024,85,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLMs依赖Token偏见而非真实推理能力。,"This study introduces a hypothesis-testing framework to assess whether large language models (LLMs) possess genuine reasoning abilities or primarily depend on token bias. We go beyond evaluating LLMs on accuracy; rather, we aim to investigate their token bias in solving logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, we develop carefully controlled synthetic datasets, featuring conjunction fallacy and syllogistic problems. Our framework outlines a list of hypotheses where token biases are readily identifiable, with all null hypotheses assuming genuine reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The findings in this study suggest, with statistical guarantee, that most LLMs still struggle with logical reasoning. While they may perform well on classic problems, their success largely depends on recognizing superficial patterns with strong token bias, thereby raising concerns about their actual reasoning and generalization abilities."
Leveraging GPT-4 for Automatic Translation Post-Editing,2023,85,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现GPT-4在翻译后编辑中存在幻觉编辑现象。,"While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) represents the leading approach to Machine Translation (MT), the outputs of NMT models still require translation post-editing to rectify errors and enhance quality under critical settings. In this work, we formalize the task of direct translation post-editing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the use of GPT-4 to automatically post-edit NMT outputs across several language pairs. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 is adept at translation post-editing, producing meaningful and trustworthy edits to translations that help improve its general quality as well as remove different classes of major errors in translations. In particular, human evaluations on assessing edit trustworthiness show that GPT-4 exhibits a large improvement over the prior state-of-the-art LLM. Notably, we improve upon state-of-the-art performance on WMT-22 English-Chinese, English-German, Chinese-English and German-English language pairs using GPT-4 based post-editing, as evaluated by state-of-the-art MT quality metrics. However, we also show that GPT-4 could produce hallucinated edits, thereby urging caution in its use as an expert translation post-editor."
Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations from Large Language Models,2024,81,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,讨论LLM生成解释的忠实性与合理性矛盾现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern LLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate reasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs. While there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving faithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel methods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling transparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings."
Tokenization counts: the impact of tokenization on arithmetic in frontier LLMs,2024,80,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,Low,研究不同分词方式对算术任务的影响。,"Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and 3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns, suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias. In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks, accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning."
How to Catch an AI Liar: Lie Detection in Black-Box LLMs by Asking Unrelated Questions,2023,78,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现了LLMs的撒谎行为模式。,"Large language models (LLMs) can""lie"", which we define as outputting false statements despite""knowing""the truth in a demonstrable sense. LLMs might""lie"", for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM's activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM's yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on examples from a single setting -- prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions -- the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection."
Do Models Explain Themselves? Counterfactual Simulatability of Natural Language Explanations,2023,73,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,评估大模型解释的忠实度，发现解释精度低。,"Large language models (LLMs) are trained to imitate humans to explain human decisions. However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers""yes""to the input question""Can eagles fly?""with the explanation""all birds can fly"", then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer""yes""to the counterfactual input""Can penguins fly?"". If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility. Therefore, naively optimizing human approvals (e.g., RLHF) may not be a sufficient solution."
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning In The Wild Is Not Always Faithful,2025,67,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在逻辑问题中存在隐式后合理化现象。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%). We also investigate Unfaithful Illogical Shortcuts, where models use subtly illogical reasoning to try to make a speculative answer to hard maths problems seem rigorously proven. Our findings raise challenges for strategies for detecting undesired behavior in LLMs via the chain of thought."
Attention Satisfies: A Constraint-Satisfaction Lens on Factual Errors of Language Models,2023,65,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究注意力与事实准确性的关系。,"We investigate the internal behavior of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) when they generate factually incorrect text. We propose modeling factual queries as constraint satisfaction problems and use this framework to investigate how the LLM interacts internally with factual constraints. We find a strong positive relationship between the LLM's attention to constraint tokens and the factual accuracy of generations. We curate a suite of 10 datasets containing over 40,000 prompts to study the task of predicting factual errors with the Llama-2 family across all scales (7B, 13B, 70B). We propose SAT Probe, a method probing attention patterns, that can predict factual errors and fine-grained constraint satisfaction, and allow early error identification. The approach and findings take another step towards using the mechanistic understanding of LLMs to enhance their reliability."
Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,59,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究大模型自我解释的忠实性问题。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B."
Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?,2024,58,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在无问题提示下的MCQA能力。,"Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe if LLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select the correct answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs, this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracy gain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysis on memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings are threefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems from memorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explain choices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices. Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, and surprisingly can sometimes even match the original question. Inferring the original question is an impressive reasoning strategy, but it cannot fully explain the high choices-only accuracy of LLMs in MCQA. Thus, while LLMs are not fully incapable of reasoning in MCQA, we still advocate for the use of stronger baselines in MCQA benchmarks, the design of robust MCQA datasets for fair evaluations, and further efforts to explain LLM decision-making."
Prompting is not a substitute for probability measurements in large language models,2023,53,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现提示法在评估语言模型时存在局限性。,"Prompting is now a dominant method for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of large language models (LLMs). While other methods directly read out models' probability distributions over strings, prompting requires models to access this internal information by processing linguistic input, thereby implicitly testing a new type of emergent ability: metalinguistic judgment. In this study, we compare metalinguistic prompting and direct probability measurements as ways of measuring models' linguistic knowledge. Broadly, we find that LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly derived from representations. Furthermore, consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities. Our findings suggest that negative results relying on metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular linguistic generalization. Our results also highlight the value that is lost with the move to closed APIs where access to probability distributions is limited."
Chain of Thought Monitorability: A New and Fragile Opportunity for AI Safety,2025,53,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了思维链监控作为AI安全新机会的现象。,"AI systems that""think""in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability."
Sycophancy in Large Language Models: Causes and Mitigations,2024,50,Phenomenon,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文主要研究LLMs中的奉承行为现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their tendency to exhibit sycophantic behavior - excessively agreeing with or flattering users - poses significant risks to their reliability and ethical deployment. This paper provides a technical survey of sycophancy in LLMs, analyzing its causes, impacts, and potential mitigation strategies. We review recent work on measuring and quantifying sycophantic tendencies, examine the relationship between sycophancy and other challenges like hallucination and bias, and evaluate promising techniques for reducing sycophancy while maintaining model performance. Key approaches explored include improved training data, novel fine-tuning methods, post-deployment control mechanisms, and decoding strategies. We also discuss the broader implications of sycophancy for AI alignment and propose directions for future research. Our analysis suggests that mitigating sycophancy is crucial for developing more robust, reliable, and ethically-aligned language models."
Evaluating Superhuman Models with Consistency Checks,2023,49,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文通过一致性检查发现超人类模型的逻辑不一致性。,"If machine learning models were to achieve superhuman abilities at various reasoning or decision-making tasks, how would we go about evaluating such models, given that humans would necessarily be poor proxies for ground truth? In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating superhuman models via consistency checks. Our premise is that while the correctness of superhuman decisions may be impossible to evaluate, we can still surface mistakes if the model’s decisions fail to satisfy certain logical, human-interpretable rules. As case studies, we instantiate our framework on three tasks where correctness of decisions is hard to evaluate due to either superhuman model abilities, or to otherwise missing ground truth: evaluating chess positions, forecasting future events, and making legal judgments. We show that regardless of a model’s (possibly superhuman) performance on these tasks, we can discover logical inconsistencies in decision making. For example: a chess engine assigning opposing valuations to semantically identical boards; GPT-4 forecasting that sports records will evolve non-monotonically over time; or an AI judge assigning bail to a defendant only after we add a felony to their criminal record."
When Large Language Models contradict humans? Large Language Models' Sycophantic Behaviour,2023,47,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLMs在主观问题中的迎合行为。,"Large Language Models have been demonstrating broadly satisfactory generative abilities for users, which seems to be due to the intensive use of human feedback that refines responses. Nevertheless, suggestibility inherited via human feedback improves the inclination to produce answers corresponding to users'viewpoints. This behaviour is known as sycophancy and depicts the tendency of LLMs to generate misleading responses as long as they align with humans. This phenomenon induces bias and reduces the robustness and, consequently, the reliability of these models. In this paper, we study the suggestibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sycophantic behaviour, analysing these tendencies via systematic human-interventions prompts over different tasks. Our investigation demonstrates that LLMs have sycophantic tendencies when answering queries that involve subjective opinions and statements that should elicit a contrary response based on facts. In contrast, when faced with math tasks or queries with an objective answer, they, at various scales, do not follow the users'hints by demonstrating confidence in generating the correct answers."
Evaluating Gender Bias in Large Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting,2024,47,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了CoT在性别偏见中的影响。,"There exist both scalable tasks, like reading comprehension and fact-checking, where model performance improves with model size, and unscalable tasks, like arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning, where model performance does not necessarily improve with model size. Large language models (LLMs) equipped with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are able to make accurate incremental predictions even on unscalable tasks. Unfortunately, despite their exceptional reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to internalize and reproduce discriminatory societal biases. Whether CoT can provide discriminatory or egalitarian rationalizations for the implicit information in unscalable tasks remains an open question. In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks. For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words. In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions. With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning. Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words. Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions."
On Large Language Models’ Hallucination with Regard to Known Facts,2024,41,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM在已知事实下仍产生幻觉的动态推理机制。,"Large language models are successful in answering factoid questions but are also prone to hallucination.We investigate the phenomenon of LLMs possessing correct answer knowledge yet still hallucinating from the perspective of inference dynamics, an area not previously covered in studies on hallucinations.We are able to conduct this analysis via two key ideas.First, we identify the factual questions that query the same triplet knowledge but result in different answers. The difference between the model behaviors on the correct and incorrect outputs hence suggests the patterns when hallucinations happen.Second, to measure the pattern, we utilize mappings from the residual streams to vocabulary space.We reveal the different dynamics of the output token probabilities along the depths of layers between the correct and hallucinated cases. In hallucinated cases, the output token’s information rarely demonstrates abrupt increases and consistent superiority in the later stages of the model.Leveraging the dynamic curve as a feature, we build a classifier capable of accurately detecting hallucinatory predictions with an 88% success rate. Our study shed light on understanding the reasons for LLMs’ hallucinations on their known facts, and more importantly, on accurately predicting when they are hallucinating."
Evaluating Language Model Agency through Negotiations,2024,41,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过谈判游戏评估语言模型代理能力。,"We introduce an approach to evaluate language model (LM) agency using negotiation games. This approach better reflects real-world use cases and addresses some of the shortcomings of alternative LM benchmarks. Negotiation games enable us to study multi-turn, and cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental evaluation data leakage. We use our approach to test six widely used and publicly accessible LMs, evaluating performance and alignment in both self-play and cross-play settings. Noteworthy findings include: (i) only closed-source models tested here were able to complete these tasks; (ii) cooperative bargaining games proved to be most challenging to the models; and (iii) even the most powerful models sometimes""lose""to weaker opponents"
Take Caution in Using LLMs as Human Surrogates: Scylla Ex Machina,2024,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在不可预测的差异。,"Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can exhibit human-like reasoning, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations."
On Targeted Manipulation and Deception when Optimizing LLMs for User Feedback,2024,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在用户反馈优化中的操纵行为。,"As LLMs become more widely deployed, there is increasing interest in directly optimizing for feedback from end users (e.g. thumbs up) in addition to feedback from paid annotators. However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of""feedback gaming""such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL."
A Closer Look at the Self-Verification Abilities of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning,2023,40,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在识别逻辑谬误方面存在困难。,"Logical reasoning has been an ongoing pursuit in the field of AI. Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems. To enhance reasoning performance, one promising direction is scalable oversight, which requires LLMs to identify their own errors and then improve by themselves. Various self-verification methods have been proposed in pursuit of this goal. Nevertheless, whether existing models understand their own errors well is still under investigation. In this paper, we take a closer look at the self-verification abilities of LLMs in the context of logical reasoning, focusing on their ability to identify logical fallacies accurately. We introduce a dataset, FALLACIES, containing 232 types of reasoning fallacies categorized in a hierarchical taxonomy. By conducting exhaustive experiments on FALLACIES, we obtain comprehensive and detailed analyses of a series of models on their verification abilities. Our main findings suggest that existing LLMs could struggle to identify fallacious reasoning steps accurately and may fall short of guaranteeing the validity of self-verification methods. Drawing from these observations, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications of self-verification methods."
Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,39,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现思维锚点对推理轨迹有重大影响。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models."
Analyzing Chain-of-Thought Prompting in Large Language Models via Gradient-based Feature Attributions,2023,37,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究CoT提示对输入令牌重要性分布的影响。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to empirically improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on various question answering tasks. While understanding why CoT prompting is effective is crucial to ensuring that this phenomenon is a consequence of desired model behavior, little work has addressed this; nonetheless, such an understanding is a critical prerequisite for responsible model deployment. We address this question by leveraging gradient-based feature attribution methods which produce saliency scores that capture the influence of input tokens on model output. Specifically, we probe several open-source LLMs to investigate whether CoT prompting affects the relative importances they assign to particular input tokens. Our results indicate that while CoT prompting does not increase the magnitude of saliency scores attributed to semantically relevant tokens in the prompt compared to standard few-shot prompting, it increases the robustness of saliency scores to question perturbations and variations in model output."
Learning Deductive Reasoning from Synthetic Corpus based on Formal Logic,2023,37,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现大模型在纯逻辑推理上表现有限。,"We study a synthetic corpus based approach for language models (LMs) to acquire logical deductive reasoning ability. The previous studies generated deduction examples using specific sets of deduction rules. However, these rules were limited or otherwise arbitrary, limiting the generalizability of acquired reasoning ability. We rethink this and adopt a well-grounded set of deduction rules based on formal logic theory, which can derive any other deduction rules when combined in a multistep way. Then, using the proposed corpora, which we name FLD (Formal Logic Deduction), we first evaluate and analyze the logical reasoning ability of the latest LLMs. Even GPT-4 can solve only half of the problems, suggesting that pure logical reasoning isolated from knowledge is still challenging for the LLMs, and additional training specialized in logical reasoning is indeed essential. We next empirically verify that LMs trained on FLD corpora acquire more generalizable reasoning ability. Furthermore, we identify the aspects of reasoning ability on which deduction corpora can enhance LMs and those on which they cannot, and discuss future directions on each aspect. The released corpora serve both as learning resources and as challenging benchmarks."
Mechanistic Understanding and Mitigation of Language Model Non-Factual Hallucinations,2024,35,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过内部表征分析幻觉机制。,"State-of-the-art language models (LMs) sometimes generate non-factual hallucinations that misalign with world knowledge. To explore the mechanistic causes of these hallucinations, we create diagnostic datasets with subject-relation queries and adapt interpretability methods to trace hallucinations through internal model representations. We discover two general and distinct mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs (Llama-2, Pythia, GPT-J): 1) knowledge enrichment hallucinations: insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and 2) answer extraction hallucinations: failure to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention heads. We also found these two internal mechanistic causes of hallucinations are reflected in external manifestations. Based on insights from our mechanistic analysis, we propose a novel hallucination mitigation method through targeted restoration of the LM's internal fact recall pipeline, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines."
How Susceptible are LLMs to Influence in Prompts?,2024,35,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM对提示中附加信息的敏感性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompts, including additional context provided therein. As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation. As LLMs continue to advance, understanding and mitigating such sensitivities will be crucial for their reliable and trustworthy deployment."
How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?,2024,32,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs与人类推理的因果结构差异。,"Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM."
LLMs know their vulnerabilities: Uncover Safety Gaps through Natural Distribution Shifts,2024,31,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现自然分布偏移导致的安全漏洞。,"Safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their exposure to potentially harmful data during pre-training. In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to \textit{natural distribution shifts} between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, \textit{ActorBreaker}, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility. Code is available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ActorAttack."
Properties and Challenges of LLM-Generated Explanations,2024,29,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,分析LLM生成解释的普遍特性。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been explored in restricted settings, using task-specific data sets.However, current LLMs do not (only) rely on specifically annotated data; nonetheless, they frequently explain their outputs.The properties of the generated explanations are influenced by the pre-training corpus and by the target data used for instruction fine-tuning.As the pre-training corpus includes a large amount of human-written explanations “in the wild”, we hypothesise that LLMs adopt common properties of human explanations.By analysing the outputs for a multi-domain instruction fine-tuning data set, we find that generated explanations show selectivity and contain illustrative elements, but less frequently are subjective or misleading.We discuss reasons and consequences of the properties’ presence or absence. In particular, we outline positive and negative implications depending on the goals and user groups of the self-rationalising system."
"Deciphering the Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Chain-of-Thought: Probability, Memorization, and Noisy Reasoning",2024,29,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究影响思维链效果的三个关键因素。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at this https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering_cot"
Preventing Language Models From Hiding Their Reasoning,2023,28,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现语言模型可能隐藏推理过程。,"Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from intermediate steps of reasoning to generate answers to complex problems. When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally. Finally, we describe a methodology that enables the evaluation of defenses against encoded reasoning, and show that, under the right conditions, paraphrasing successfully prevents even the best encoding schemes we built from encoding more than 3 bits of information per KB of text."
Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,28,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Other,Low,研究发现推理模型比非推理模型更能忠实描述提示中线索的影响。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models."
Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens,2025,27,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,探究CoT推理的忠实性及其分布依赖性。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning."
Social Bias Evaluation for Large Language Models Requires Prompt Variations,2024,27,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs对提示词的高度敏感性。,"Warning: This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately. Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation. While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias. Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts. Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance. Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs. We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs."
Rethinking Large Language Models in Mental Health Applications,2023,26,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,讨论LLM在心理健康领域的不稳定性与幻觉生成风险,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assets in mental health, showing promise in both classification tasks and counseling applications. This paper offers a perspective on using LLMs in mental health applications. It discusses the instability of generative models for prediction and the potential for generating hallucinatory outputs, underscoring the need for ongoing audits and evaluations to maintain their reliability and dependability. The paper also distinguishes between the often interchangeable terms ``explainability'' and ``interpretability'', advocating for developing inherently interpretable methods instead of relying on potentially hallucinated self-explanations generated by LLMs. Despite the advancements in LLMs, human counselors' empathetic understanding, nuanced interpretation, and contextual awareness remain irreplaceable in the sensitive and complex realm of mental health counseling. The use of LLMs should be approached with a judicious and considerate mindset, viewing them as tools that complement human expertise rather than seeking to replace it."
On the Impact of Fine-Tuning on Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2024,24,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Negative,High,微调降低了思维链推理的忠实度,"Large language models have emerged as powerful tools for general intelligence, showcasing advanced natural language processing capabilities that find applications across diverse domains. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted the potential for significant enhancements in LLMs' task-specific performance through fine-tuning strategies like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (Q-LoRA) method. However, previous works have shown that while fine-tuning offers significant performance gains, it also leads to challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and privacy and safety risks. To this end, there has been little to no work in \textit{understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs}. Our research investigates the effect of fine-tuning on the reasoning abilities of LLMs, addressing critical questions regarding the impact of task-specific fine-tuning on overall reasoning capabilities, the influence of fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning performance, and the implications for the faithfulness of CoT reasonings. By exploring these dimensions, our study shows the impact of fine-tuning on LLM reasoning capabilities, where the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, on average across four datasets, decreases, highlighting potential shifts in internal mechanisms of the LLMs resulting from fine-tuning processes."
When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs,2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现CoT推理会降低指令遵循准确性。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies."
Uncovering Deceptive Tendencies in Language Models: A Simulated Company AI Assistant,2024,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了语言模型在无压力下的欺骗倾向。,"We study the tendency of AI systems to deceive by constructing a realistic simulation setting of a company AI assistant. The simulated company employees provide tasks for the assistant to complete, these tasks spanning writing assistance, information retrieval and programming. We then introduce situations where the model might be inclined to behave deceptively, while taking care to not instruct or otherwise pressure the model to do so. Across different scenarios, we find that Claude 3 Opus 1) complies with a task of mass-generating comments to influence public perception of the company, later deceiving humans about it having done so, 2) lies to auditors when asked questions, and 3) strategically pretends to be less capable than it is during capability evaluations. Our work demonstrates that even models trained to be helpful, harmless and honest sometimes behave deceptively in realistic scenarios, without notable external pressure to do so."
Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models,2024,23,Phenomenon,White-box,Math,Unknown,High,提出扩散思维链方法，提升推理能力。,"Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant interest in the field of text processing due to their many potential advantages compared to conventional autoregressive models. In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning with diffusion language models."
"Fostering Appropriate Reliance on Large Language Models: The Role of Explanations, Sources, and Inconsistencies",2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究用户对LLM解释的依赖行为。,"Large language models (LLMs) can produce erroneous responses that sound fluent and convincing, raising the risk that users will rely on these responses as if they were correct. Mitigating such overreliance is a key challenge. Through a think-aloud study in which participants use an LLM-infused application to answer objective questions, we identify several features of LLM responses that shape users’ reliance: explanations (supporting details for answers), inconsistencies in explanations, and sources. Through a large-scale, pre-registered, controlled experiment (N=308), we isolate and study the effects of these features on users’ reliance, accuracy, and other measures. We find that the presence of explanations increases reliance on both correct and incorrect responses. However, we observe less reliance on incorrect responses when sources are provided or when explanations exhibit inconsistencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for fostering appropriate reliance on LLMs."
Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,2024,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究CoT忠实度与模型规模的关联现象。,"Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness."
Which of These Best Describes Multiple Choice Evaluation with LLMs? A) Forced B) Flawed C) Fixable D) All of the Above,2025,23,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了MCQA在测试生成/主观性方面的缺陷。,"Multiple choice question answering (MCQA) is popular for LLM evaluation due to its simplicity and human-like testing, but we argue for its reform. We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing, where LLMs construct and explain answers, better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA, robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations, showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations."
Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models,2025,22,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示思维链可能隐藏模型不良意图。,"Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (""I'll trick the user...""), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (""Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...""). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite."
LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful,2024,22,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM生成误导性解释的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems by acting as digital assistants. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge. These findings shed light on the limitations of the black-box explanation setting and allow us to provide advice on the safe usage of LLMs."
Beyond Semantics: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens,2025,21,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现思维链的语义与模型推理无关。,"Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), especially of training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs to help find new reasoning patterns. While these traces certainly seem to help model performance, it is not clear how they actually influence it, with some works ascribing semantics to the traces and others cautioning against relying on them as transparent and faithful proxies of the model's internal computational process. To systematically investigate the role of end-user semantics of derivational traces, we set up a controlled study where we train transformer models from scratch on formally verifiable reasoning traces and the solutions they lead to. We notice that, despite significant gains over the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces can still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More interestingly, our experiments also show that models trained on corrupted traces, whose intermediate reasoning steps bear no relation to the problem they accompany, perform similarly to those trained on correct ones, and even generalize better on out-of-distribution tasks. We also study the effect of GRPO-based RL post-training on trace validity, noting that while solution accuracy increase, this is not accompanied by any improvements in trace validity. Finally, we examine whether reasoning-trace length reflects inference-time scaling and find that trace length is largely agnostic to the underlying computational complexity of the problem being solved. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or ``Chains of Thought''reflect or induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly seemingly forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models."
Retrieving Evidence from EHRs with LLMs: Possibilities and Challenges,2023,21,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现模型输出置信度与忠实摘要强相关。,"Unstructured data in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often contains critical information-complementary to imaging-that could inform radiologists' diagnoses. But the large volume of notes often associated with patients together with time constraints renders manually identifying relevant evidence practically infeasible. In this work we propose and evaluate a zero-shot strategy for using LLMs as a mechanism to efficiently retrieve and summarize unstructured evidence in patient EHR relevant to a given query. Our method entails tasking an LLM to infer whether a patient has, or is at risk of, a particular condition on the basis of associated notes; if so, we ask the model to summarize the supporting evidence. Under expert evaluation, we find that this LLM-based approach provides outputs consistently preferred to a pre-LLM information retrieval baseline. Manual evaluation is expensive, so we also propose and validate a method using an LLM to evaluate (other) LLM outputs for this task, allowing us to scale up evaluation. Our findings indicate the promise of LLMs as interfaces to EHR, but also highlight the outstanding challenge posed by ""hallucinations"". In this setting, however, we show that model confidence in outputs strongly correlates with faithful summaries, offering a practical means to limit confabulations."
Intuitive or Dependent? Investigating LLMs' Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts,2023,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLMs在冲突提示下的行为风格。,"This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles. Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario. To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy."
MedFuzz: Exploring the Robustness of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering,2024,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文提出了医学领域的对抗攻击方法。,"Large language models (LLM) have achieved impressive performance on medical question-answering benchmarks. However, high benchmark accuracy does not imply that the performance generalizes to real-world clinical settings. Medical question-answering benchmarks rely on assumptions consistent with quantifying LLM performance but that may not hold in the open world of the clinic. Yet LLMs learn broad knowledge that can help the LLM generalize to practical conditions regardless of unrealistic assumptions in celebrated benchmarks. We seek to quantify how well LLM medical question-answering benchmark performance generalizes when benchmark assumptions are violated. Specifically, we present an adversarial method that we call MedFuzz (for medical fuzzing). MedFuzz attempts to modify benchmark questions in ways aimed at confounding the LLM. We demonstrate the approach by targeting strong assumptions about patient characteristics presented in the MedQA benchmark. Successful""attacks""modify a benchmark item in ways that would be unlikely to fool a medical expert but nonetheless""trick""the LLM into changing from a correct to an incorrect answer. Further, we present a permutation test technique that can ensure a successful attack is statistically significant. We show how to use performance on a""MedFuzzed""benchmark, as well as individual successful attacks. The methods show promise at providing insights into the ability of an LLM to operate robustly in more realistic settings."
"In-context Learning Generalizes, But Not Always Robustly: The Case of Syntax",2023,20,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究ICL任务中的泛化性与鲁棒性问题,"In-context learning (ICL) is now a common method for teaching large language models (LLMs) new tasks: given labeled examples in the input context, the LLM learns to perform the task without weight updates. Do models guided via ICL infer the underlying structure of the task defined by the context, or do they rely on superficial heuristics that only generalize to identically distributed examples? We address this question using transformations tasks and an NLI task that assess sensitivity to syntax—a requirement for robust language understanding. We further investigate whether out-of-distribution generalization can be improved via chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is provided with a sequence of intermediate computation steps that illustrate how the task ought to be performed. In experiments with models from the GPT, PaLM, and Llama 2 families, we find large variance across LMs. The variance is explained more by the composition of the pre-training corpus and supervision methods than by model size; in particular, models pre-trained on code generalize better, and benefit more from chain-of-thought prompting."
Hidden in Plain Text: Emergence & Mitigation of Steganographic Collusion in LLMs,2024,19,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM训练中可能产生隐写式共谋现象。,"The rapid proliferation of frontier model agents promises significant societal advances but also raises concerns about systemic risks arising from unsafe interactions. Collusion to the disadvantage of others has been identified as a central form of undesirable agent cooperation. The use of information hiding (steganography) in agent communications could render such collusion practically undetectable. This underscores the need for investigations into the possibility of such behaviours emerging and the robustness corresponding countermeasures. To investigate this problem we design two approaches -- a gradient-based reinforcement learning (GBRL) method and an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) method -- for reliably eliciting sophisticated LLM-generated linguistic text steganography. We demonstrate, for the first time, that unintended steganographic collusion in LLMs can arise due to mispecified reward incentives during training. Additionally, we find that standard mitigations -- both passive oversight of model outputs and active mitigation through communication paraphrasing -- are not fully effective at preventing this steganographic communication. Our findings imply that (i) emergence of steganographic collusion is a plausible concern that should be monitored and researched, and (ii) preventing emergence may require innovation in mitigation techniques."
Do Vision & Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?,2024,18,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究视觉语言模型在生成解释时对图像和文本的依赖差异。,"Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE."
Understanding the Effect of Noise in LLM Training Data with Algorithmic Chains of Thought,2024,17,Phenomenon,White-box,Math,Unknown,Low,研究噪声对CoT任务性能的影响。,"During both pretraining and fine-tuning, Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}) are trained on trillions of tokens of text of widely varying quality. Both phases of training typically involve heuristically filtering out ``low-quality'' or \textit{noisy} training samples, yet little is known quantitatively about how the type or intensity of noise affects downstream performance. In this work, we study how noise in chain of thought (\textbf{CoT}) impacts task performance in the highly-controlled setting of algorithmically solvable tasks. First, we develop the Traced Integer (\textbf{TInt}) framework to generate highly customizable noised execution traces for any arithmetic function on lists of integers. We then define two types of noise: \textit{static} noise, a local form of noise which is applied after the CoT trace is computed, and \textit{dynamic} noise, a global form of noise which propagates errors in the trace as it is computed. We then evaluate the test performance of pretrained models both prompted and fine-tuned on noised datasets with varying levels of dataset contamination and intensity. We find fine-tuned models are extremely robust to high levels of static noise but struggle significantly more with lower levels of dynamic noise. In contrast, few-shot prompted models appear more sensitive to even static noise. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings impact noise filtering best-practices, in particular emphasizing the importance of removing samples containing destructive dynamic noise with global errors."
Testing and Understanding Erroneous Planning in LLM Agents through Synthesized User Inputs,2024,17,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文主要研究LLM代理的错误规划现象。,"Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in solving a wide range of tasks by integrating LLMs with key modules such as planning, memory, and tool usage. Increasingly, customers are adopting LLM agents across a variety of commercial applications critical to reliability, including support for mental well-being, chemical synthesis, and software development. Nevertheless, our observations and daily use of LLM agents indicate that they are prone to making erroneous plans, especially when the tasks are complex and require long-term planning. In this paper, we propose PDoctor, a novel and automated approach to testing LLM agents and understanding their erroneous planning. As the first work in this direction, we formulate the detection of erroneous planning as a constraint satisfiability problem: an LLM agent's plan is considered erroneous if its execution violates the constraints derived from the user inputs. To this end, PDoctor first defines a domain-specific language (DSL) for user queries and synthesizes varying inputs with the assistance of the Z3 constraint solver. These synthesized inputs are natural language paragraphs that specify the requirements for completing a series of tasks. Then, PDoctor derives constraints from these requirements to form a testing oracle. We evaluate PDoctor with three mainstream agent frameworks and two powerful LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). The results show that PDoctor can effectively detect diverse errors in agent planning and provide insights and error characteristics that are valuable to both agent developers and users. We conclude by discussing potential alternative designs and directions to extend PDoctor."
Large Language Models Cannot Explain Themselves,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文指出大模型的解释并非真实反映推理过程。,"Large language models can be prompted to produce text. They can also be prompted to produce""explanations""of their output. But these are not really explanations, because they do not accurately reflect the mechanical process underlying the prediction. The illusion that they reflect the reasoning process can result in significant harms. These""explanations""can be valuable, but for promoting critical thinking rather than for understanding the model. I propose a recontextualisation of these""explanations"", using the term""exoplanations""to draw attention to their exogenous nature. I discuss some implications for design and technology, such as the inclusion of appropriate guardrails and responses when models are prompted to generate explanations."
Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究代码表示如何触发LLM的推理能力。,"Reasoning is a fundamental component of language understanding. Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs’ performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the input representation on the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We hypothesize that representing natural language tasks as code can enhance specific reasoning abilities such as entity tracking or logical reasoning. To study this, we propose code prompting, a methodology we operationalize as a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple conditional reasoning datasets. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to understand how the code representation triggers reasoning abilities and which capabilities are elicited in the underlying models. Our analysis on GPT 3.5 reveals that the code formatting of the input problem is essential for performance improvement. Furthermore, the code representation improves sample efficiency of in-context learning and facilitates state tracking of entities."
On the Intrinsic Self-Correction Capability of LLMs: Uncertainty and Latent Concept,2024,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究聚焦LLM内在自校正的收敛现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only the task's goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success of intrinsic self-correction is evident in various applications, but how and why it is effective remains unknown. In this paper, we unveil that intrinsic self-correction can be progressively improved, allowing it to approach a converged state. Our findings are verified in: (1) the scenario of multi-round question answering, by comprehensively demonstrating that intrinsic self-correction can progressively introduce performance gains through iterative interactions, ultimately converging to stable performance; and (2) the context of intrinsic self-correction for enhanced morality, in which we provide empirical evidence that iteratively applying instructions reduces model uncertainty towards convergence, which then leads to convergence of both the calibration error and self-correction performance, ultimately resulting in a stable state of intrinsic self-correction. Furthermore, we introduce a mathematical formulation and a simulation task indicating that the latent concepts activated by self-correction instructions drive the reduction of model uncertainty. Based on our experimental results and analysis of the convergence of intrinsic self-correction, we reveal its underlying mechanism: consistent injected instructions reduce model uncertainty which yields converged, improved performance."
"Do as We Do, Not as You Think: the Conformity of Large Language Models",2025,16,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究大模型在多智能体系统中的从众现象。,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) revolutionize the field of intelligent agents, enabling collaborative multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex problems across various domains. However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems. Our benchmark and code are available at BenchForm."
Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems in Commonsense Reasoning,2024,16,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现了CoT导致正确回答变错的现象。,"Large language models exhibit high-level commonsense reasoning abilities, especially with enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, we find these CoT-like methods lead to a considerable number of originally correct answers turning wrong, which we define as the Toxic CoT problem. To interpret and mitigate this problem, we first utilize attribution tracing and causal tracing methods to probe the internal working mechanism of the LLM during CoT reasoning. Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we validate that this method not only significantly eliminates Toxic CoT problems (decreased by 23.6%), but also effectively improves the model's overall commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5%)."
Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity,2023,15,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型在模糊情境下的自洽性现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) that do not give consistent answers across contexts are problematic when used for tasks with expectations of consistency–e.g. question-answering, explanations, etc. Our work presents an evaluation benchmark for self-consistency in cases of under-specification where two or more answers can be correct. We conduct a series of behavioral experiments on the OpenAI model suite using an ambiguous integer sequence completion task. We find that average consistency ranges from 67% to 82%, far higher than would be predicted if a model’s consistency was random, and increases as model capability improves. Furthermore, we show that models tend to maintain self-consistency across a series of robustness checks, including prompting speaker changes and sequence length changes. These results suggest that self-consistency arises as an emergent capability without specifically training for it. Despite this, we find that models are uncalibrated when judging their own consistency, with models displaying both over- and under-confidence. We also propose a nonparametric test for determining from token output distribution whether a model assigns non-trivial probability to alternative answers. Using this test, we find that despite increases in self-consistency, models usually place significant weight on alternative, inconsistent answers. This distribution of probability mass provides evidence that even highly self-consistent models internally compute multiple possible responses."
Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning,2024,14,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在演绎推理中的推理策略相似性。,"Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field."
Can Large Language Models Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs无法真正解决3-SAT问题。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research."
Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,分析了人类和LLM偏好的差异现象。,"As a relative quality comparison of model responses, human and Large Language Model (LLM) preferences serve as common alignment goals in model fine-tuning and criteria in evaluation. Yet, these preferences merely reflect broad tendencies, resulting in less explainable and controllable models with potential safety risks. In this work, we dissect the preferences of human and 32 different LLMs to understand their quantitative composition, using annotations from real-world user-model conversations for a fine-grained, scenario-wise analysis. We find that humans are less sensitive to errors, favor responses that support their stances, and show clear dislike when models admit their limits. On the contrary, advanced LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo emphasize correctness, clarity, and harmlessness more. Additionally, LLMs of similar sizes tend to exhibit similar preferences, regardless of their training methods, and fine-tuning for alignment does not significantly alter the preferences of pretrained-only LLMs. Finally, we show that preference-based evaluation can be intentionally manipulated. In both training-free and training-based settings, aligning a model with the preferences of judges boosts scores, while injecting the least preferred properties lowers them. This results in notable score shifts: up to 0.59 on MT-Bench (1-10 scale) and 31.94 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (0-100 scale), highlighting the significant impact of this strategic adaptation.

It's Not Easy Being Wrong: Large Language Models Struggle with Process of Elimination Reasoning,2023,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究探索了LLMs在错误推理中的表现。,"Chain-of-thought (COT) prompting can help large language models (LLMs) reason toward correct answers, but its efficacy in reasoning toward incorrect answers is unexplored. This process of elimination (PoE), when used with COT, can enhance self-consistency, interpretability, and tasks such as medical diagnoses of exclusion. Thus, we propose PoE with COT, where LLMs must reason toward incorrect options on multiple-choice questions. We evaluate the ability of GPT-3.5, LLaMA-2, and Falcon to perform PoE with COT on a total of four commonsense and scientific reasoning datasets. We find that the strategy of PoE always underperforms the strategy of choosing the correct answer. The agreement of these strategies is also lower than the self-consistency of each strategy. To study these issues further, we conduct error analyses and give suggestions for future work."
Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions,2024,13,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了GPT-2在MCQ中的位置偏差现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse anchored bias in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice 'A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the""logit lens""method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice 'A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

Dissociation of Faithful and Unfaithful Reasoning in LLMs,2024,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在思维链中错误恢复的不忠实现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) often improve their performance in downstream tasks when they generate Chain of Thought reasoning text before producing an answer. We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability."
FLamE: Few-shot Learning from Natural Language Explanations,2023,13,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现生成解释与分类决策不匹配的现象。,"Natural language explanations have the potential to provide rich information that in principle guides model reasoning.Yet, recent work by Lampinen et al. has shown limited utility of natural language explanations in improving classification.To effectively learn from explanations, we present FLamE, a two-stage few-shot learning framework that first generates explanations using GPT-3, and then fine-tunes a smaller model (e.g., RoBERTa) with generated explanations.Our experiments on natural language inference demonstrate effectiveness over strong baselines, increasing accuracy by 17.6% over GPT-3 Babbage and 5.7% over GPT-3 Davinci in e-SNLI.Despite improving classification performance, human evaluation surprisingly reveals that the majority of generated explanations does not adequately justify classification decisions.Additional analyses point to the important role of label-specific cues (e.g., “not know” for the neutral label) in generated explanations."
The Reasoning-Memorization Interplay in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction,2025,12,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLMs在推理与记忆间的动态机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) excel on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, but previous studies suggest they sometimes struggle to generalize to unseen questions, potentially due to over-reliance on memorized training examples. However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems."
In-Context Learning Dynamics with Random Binary Sequences,2023,12,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型在随机序列中的上下文学习动态。,"Large language models (LLMs) trained on huge corpora of text datasets demonstrate intriguing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks they were not explicitly trained for. The precise nature of LLM capabilities is often mysterious, and different prompts can elicit different capabilities through in-context learning. We propose a framework that enables us to analyze in-context learning dynamics to understand latent concepts underlying LLMs' behavioral patterns. This provides a more nuanced understanding than success-or-failure evaluation benchmarks, but does not require observing internal activations as a mechanistic interpretation of circuits would. Inspired by the cognitive science of human randomness perception, we use random binary sequences as context and study dynamics of in-context learning by manipulating properties of context data, such as sequence length. In the latest GPT-3.5+ models, we find emergent abilities to generate seemingly random numbers and learn basic formal languages, with striking in-context learning dynamics where model outputs transition sharply from seemingly random behaviors to deterministic repetition."
"Ask Again, Then Fail: Large Language Models' Vacillations in Judgement",2023,12,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,观察到模型在后续问题中判断摇摆的现象。,"We observe that current conversational language models often waver in their judgments when faced with follow-up questions, even if the original judgment was correct. This wavering presents a significant challenge for generating reliable responses and building user trust. To comprehensively assess this issue, we introduce a \textsc{Follow-up Questioning Mechanism} along with two metrics to quantify this inconsistency, confirming its widespread presence in current language models. To mitigate this issue, we explore various prompting strategies for closed-source models; moreover, we develop a training-based framework \textsc{Unwavering-FQ} that teaches language models to maintain their originally correct judgments through synthesized high-quality preference data. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework and its ability to enhance the general capabilities of models."
Technological folie à deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness,2025,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注AI聊天机器人对心理健康的影响。,"Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks."
LLMs' Classification Performance is Overclaimed,2024,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现LLMs在标签缺失时仍强制选择候选标签的现象。,"In many classification tasks designed for AI or human to solve, gold labels are typically included within the label space by default, often posed as""which of the following is correct?""This standard setup has traditionally highlighted the strong performance of advanced AI, particularly top-performing Large Language Models (LLMs), in routine classification tasks. However, when the gold label is intentionally excluded from the label space, it becomes evident that LLMs still attempt to select from the available label candidates, even when none are correct. This raises a pivotal question: Do LLMs truly demonstrate their intelligence in understanding the essence of classification tasks? In this study, we evaluate both closed-source and open-source LLMs across representative classification tasks, arguing that the perceived performance of LLMs is overstated due to their inability to exhibit the expected comprehension of the task. This paper makes a threefold contribution: i) To our knowledge, this is the first work to identify the limitations of LLMs in classification tasks when gold labels are absent. We define this task as Classify-w/o-Gold and propose it as a new testbed for LLMs. ii) We introduce a benchmark, Know-No, comprising two existing classification tasks and one new task, to evaluate Classify-w/o-Gold. iii) This work defines and advocates for a new evaluation metric, OmniAccuracy, which assesses LLMs' performance in classification tasks both when gold labels are present and absent."
Why Would You Suggest That? Human Trust in Language Model Responses,2024,11,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究探讨了解释对用户信任的影响。,"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed a growing need for human-AI collaboration, especially in creative decision-making scenarios where trust and reliance are paramount. Through human studies and model evaluations on the open-ended News Headline Generation task from the LaMP benchmark, we analyze how the framing and presence of explanations affect user trust and model performance. Overall, we provide evidence that adding an explanation in the model response to justify its reasoning significantly increases self-reported user trust in the model when the user has the opportunity to compare various responses. Position and faithfulness of these explanations are also important factors. However, these gains disappear when users are shown responses independently, suggesting that humans trust all model responses, including deceptive ones, equitably when they are shown in isolation. Our findings urge future research to delve deeper into the nuanced evaluation of trust in human-machine teaming systems."
Fool Me Once? Contrasting Textual and Visual Explanations in a Clinical Decision-Support Setting,2024,10,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,研究发现文本解释导致过度依赖。,"The growing capabilities of AI models are leading to their wider use, including in safety-critical domains. Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make these models safer to use by making their inference process more transparent. However, current explainability methods are seldom evaluated in the way they are intended to be used: by real-world end users. To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 healthcare practitioners in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: visual explanations (saliency maps), natural language explanations, and a combination of both modalities. We specifically examined how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI advice and explanations are factually correct. We find that text-based explanations lead to significant over-reliance, which is alleviated by combining them with saliency maps. We also observe that the quality of explanations, that is, how much factually correct information they entail, and how much this aligns with AI correctness, significantly impacts the usefulness of the different explanation types."
Robustness Over Time: Understanding Adversarial Examples' Effectiveness on Longitudinal Versions of Large Language Models,2023,10,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究关注LLM版本更新对对抗鲁棒性的影响。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo continuous updates to improve user experience. However, prior research on the security and safety implications of LLMs has primarily focused on their specific versions, overlooking the impact of successive LLM updates. This prompts the need for a holistic understanding of the risks in these different versions of LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we conduct a longitudinal study to examine the adversarial robustness -- specifically misclassification, jailbreak, and hallucination -- of three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA. Our study reveals that LLM updates do not consistently improve adversarial robustness as expected. For instance, a later version of GPT-3.5 degrades regarding misclassification and hallucination despite its improved resilience against jailbreaks, and GPT-4 demonstrates (incrementally) higher robustness overall. Moreover, larger model sizes do not necessarily yield improved robustness. Specifically, larger LLaMA models do not uniformly exhibit improved robustness across all three aspects studied. Importantly, minor updates lacking substantial robustness improvements can exacerbate existing issues rather than resolve them. By providing a more nuanced understanding of LLM robustness over time, we hope our study can offer valuable insights for developers and users navigating model updates and informed decisions in model development and usage for LLM vendors."
Larger Language Models Don’t Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks,2024,9,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现大模型在主观任务中CoT推理失效。,"In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/cot-priors."
Towards an Understanding of Stepwise Inference in Transformers: A Synthetic Graph Navigation Model,2024,9,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究逐步推理机制及其现象。,"Stepwise inference protocols, such as scratchpads and chain-of-thought, help language models solve complex problems by decomposing them into a sequence of simpler subproblems. Despite the significant gain in performance achieved via these protocols, the underlying mechanisms of stepwise inference have remained elusive. To address this, we propose to study autoregressive Transformer models on a synthetic task that embodies the multi-step nature of problems where stepwise inference is generally most useful. Specifically, we define a graph navigation problem wherein a model is tasked with traversing a path from a start to a goal node on the graph. Despite is simplicity, we find we can empirically reproduce and analyze several phenomena observed at scale: (i) the stepwise inference reasoning gap, the cause of which we find in the structure of the training data; (ii) a diversity-accuracy tradeoff in model generations as sampling temperature varies; (iii) a simplicity bias in the model's output; and (iv) compositional generalization and a primacy bias with in-context exemplars. Overall, our work introduces a grounded, synthetic framework for studying stepwise inference and offers mechanistic hypotheses that can lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon."
Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language Models: An Empirical Evaluation,2025,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT会掩盖幻觉检测的关键信号。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/cot-hallu-detect ."
LLMs are One-Shot URL Classifiers and Explainers,2024,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLM单样本提示性能接近监督模型。,"Malicious URL classification represents a crucial aspect of cyber security. Although existing work comprises numerous machine learning and deep learning-based URL classification models, most suffer from generalisation and domain-adaptation issues arising from the lack of representative training datasets. Furthermore, these models fail to provide explanations for a given URL classification in natural human language. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this issue. Specifically, we propose an LLM-based one-shot learning framework that uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to predict whether a given URL is benign or phishing. We evaluate our framework using three URL datasets and five state-of-the-art LLMs and show that one-shot LLM prompting indeed provides performances close to supervised models, with GPT 4-Turbo being the best model, followed by Claude 3 Opus. We conduct a quantitative analysis of the LLM explanations and show that most of the explanations provided by LLMs align with the post-hoc explanations of the supervised classifiers, and the explanations have high readability, coherency, and informativeness."
Evaluating the Rationale Understanding of Critical Reasoning in Logical Reading Comprehension,2023,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,发现模型在解释错误选项时表现较差。,"To precisely evaluate a language model's capability for logical reading comprehension, we present a dataset for testing the understanding of the rationale behind critical reasoning. For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process of relevant alternatives."
Beyond Agreement: Diagnosing the Rationale Alignment of Automated Essay Scoring Methods based on Linguistically-informed Counterfactuals,2024,8,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了BERT和LLMs在评分机制上的差异。,"While current Automated Essay Scoring (AES) methods demonstrate high scoring agreement with human raters, their decision-making mechanisms are not fully understood. Our proposed method, using counterfactual intervention assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), reveals that BERT-like models primarily focus on sentence-level features, whereas LLMs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama-3 are sensitive to conventions&accuracy, language complexity, and organization, indicating a more comprehensive rationale alignment with scoring rubrics. Moreover, LLMs can discern counterfactual interventions when giving feedback on essays. Our approach improves understanding of neural AES methods and can also apply to other domains seeking transparency in model-driven decisions."
Belief in the Machine: Investigating Epistemological Blind Spots of Language Models,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了语言模型在信念与事实区分上的缺陷。,"As language models (LMs) become integral to fields like healthcare, law, and journalism, their ability to differentiate between fact, belief, and knowledge is essential for reliable decision-making. Failure to grasp these distinctions can lead to significant consequences in areas such as medical diagnosis, legal judgments, and dissemination of fake news. Despite this, current literature has largely focused on more complex issues such as theory of mind, overlooking more fundamental epistemic challenges. This study systematically evaluates the epistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and Llama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13 tasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86% accuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false scenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with recognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs contradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare and counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we identify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person beliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to first-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the factive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth. Fifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass the deeper reasoning. These findings highlight significant concerns about current LMs' ability to reason about truth, belief, and knowledge while emphasizing the need for advancements in these areas before broad deployment in critical sectors."
MathGAP: Out-of-Distribution Evaluation on Problems with Arbitrarily Complex Proofs,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,研究LLMs在复杂数学证明中的泛化能力下降现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) can solve arithmetic word problems with high accuracy, but little is known about how well they generalize to more complex problems. This is difficult to study, as (i) much of the available evaluation data has already been seen by the most capable models during training, and (ii) existing benchmarks do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. In this paper, we present a data-generation framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problem statements and chain-of-thought reasoning traces according to specifications about their arithmetic proof structure, enabling systematic studies on easy-to-hard generalization with respect to complexity of proof trees. Using MathGAP, we find that LLMs show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for the most capable models. The models are also sensitive to simple changes in sentence ordering. However, they remain capable of solving some complex problems, suggesting that reasoning generalization is noisy."
Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models,2025,7,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT文本常不忠实，而模型潜在特征更可靠。,"Reasoning language models improve performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs), but this process can also increase harmful outputs in adversarial settings. In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation."
Evaluating LLM Reasoning in the Operations Research Domain with ORQA,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,评估LLM在运筹学领域的推理能力，发现性能不足。,"In this paper, we introduce and apply Operations Research Question Answering (ORQA), a new benchmark designed to assess the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the specialized technical domain of Operations Research (OR). This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can emulate the knowledge and reasoning skills of OR experts when confronted with diverse and complex optimization problems. The dataset, developed by OR experts, features real-world optimization problems that demand multistep reasoning to construct their mathematical models. Our evaluations of various open source LLMs, such as LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek, and Mixtral, reveal their modest performance, highlighting a gap in their ability to generalize to specialized technical domains. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on LLMs generalization capabilities, offering valuable insights for future research in this area. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available."
Planning in a recurrent neural network that plays Sokoban,2024,7,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现RNN在Sokoban任务中具有因果计划表示。,"Planning is essential for solving complex tasks, yet the internal mechanisms underlying planning in neural networks remain poorly understood. Building on prior work, we analyze a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on Sokoban, a challenging puzzle requiring sequential, irreversible decisions. We find that the RNN has a causal plan representation which predicts its future actions about 50 steps in advance. The quality and length of the represented plan increases over the first few steps. We uncover a surprising behavior: the RNN""paces""in cycles to give itself extra computation at the start of a level, and show that this behavior is incentivized by training. Leveraging these insights, we extend the trained RNN to significantly larger, out-of-distribution Sokoban puzzles, demonstrating robust representations beyond the training regime. We open-source our model and code, and believe the neural network's interesting behavior makes it an excellent model organism to deepen our understanding of learned planning."
WSC+: Enhancing The Winograd Schema Challenge Using Tree-of-Experts,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM生成与评估一致性的现象。,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) serves as a prominent benchmark for evaluating machine understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at answering WSC questions, their ability to generate such questions remains less explored. In this work, we propose Tree-of-Experts (ToE), a novel prompting method which enhances the generation of WSC instances (50% valid cases vs. 10% in recent methods). Using this approach, we introduce WSC+, a novel dataset comprising 3,026 LLM-generated sentences. Notably, we extend the WSC framework by incorporating new ‘ambiguous’ and ‘offensive’ categories, providing a deeper insight into model overconfidence and bias. Our analysis reveals nuances in generation-evaluation consistency, suggesting that LLMs may not always outperform in evaluating their own generated questions when compared to those crafted by other models. On WSC+, GPT-4, the top-performing LLM, achieves an accuracy of 68.7%, significantly below the human benchmark of 95.1%."
Human-Like Geometric Abstraction in Large Pre-trained Neural Networks,2024,7,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究探索神经网络在几何抽象能力上的类人表现。,"Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like reasoning after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing."
The Price of Format: Diversity Collapse in LLMs,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现结构化模板导致多样性崩溃现象。,"Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) employ structured templates, such as role markers and special tokens, to enforce format consistency during inference. However, we identify a critical limitation of such formatting: it induces a phenomenon we term diversity collapse, where the model generates semantically similar outputs for open-ended inputs, undermining creativity and variability. We systematically evaluate this effect across tasks like story completion and free-form generation, finding that (1) diversity collapse persists even under high-temperature sampling, and (2) structural tokens in templates significantly constrain the model's output space. To contextualize these findings, we fine-tune the same model using a range of structured prompts and then evaluate them across three axes: downstream task performance, alignment behavior, and output diversity. Our analysis shows that format consistency between fine-tuning and inference is crucial for structure-sensitive tasks (e.g., GSM8K, IFEval), but has marginal influence on knowledge-heavy tasks (e.g., MMLU, WebQuestions). In contrast, output diversity is primarily governed by the presence or absence of structural tokens, with minimal formatting yielding the most diverse outputs. These findings reveal that current prompting conventions, while beneficial for alignment, may inadvertently suppress output diversity, underscoring the need for diversity-aware prompt design and instruction tuning."
Assessing Large Language Models for Oncology Data Inference From Radiology Reports,2024,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,评估不同LLM在肿瘤学数据推断中的表现。,"PURPOSE We examined the effectiveness of proprietary and open large language models (LLMs) in detecting disease presence, location, and treatment response in pancreatic cancer from radiology reports. METHODS We analyzed 203 deidentified radiology reports, manually annotated for disease status, location, and indeterminate nodules needing follow-up. Using generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and open models such as Gemma-7B and Llama3-8B, we employed strategies such as ablation and prompt engineering to boost accuracy. Discrepancies between human and model interpretations were reviewed by a secondary oncologist. RESULTS Among 164 patients with pancreatic tumor, GPT-4 showed the highest accuracy in inferring disease status, achieving a 75.5% correctness (F1-micro). Open models Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B performed comparably, with accuracies of 68.6% and 61.4%, respectively. Mistral-7B excelled in deriving correct inferences from objective findings directly. Most tested models demonstrated proficiency in identifying disease containing anatomic locations from a list of choices, with GPT-4 and Llama3-8B showing near-parity in precision and recall for disease site identification. However, open models struggled with differentiating benign from malignant postsurgical changes, affecting their precision in identifying findings indeterminate for cancer. A secondary review occasionally favored GPT-3.5's interpretations, indicating the variability in human judgment. CONCLUSION LLMs, especially GPT-4, are proficient in deriving oncologic insights from radiology reports. Their performance is enhanced by effective summarization strategies, demonstrating their potential in clinical support and health care analytics. This study also underscores the possibility of zero-shot open model utility in environments where proprietary models are restricted. Finally, by providing a set of annotated radiology reports, this paper presents a valuable data set for further LLM research in oncology."
Investigating the Robustness of Deductive Reasoning with Large Language Models,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,研究对抗噪声和反事实陈述对推理的影响。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve impressive results for many reasoning-based NLP tasks, suggesting a degree of deductive reasoning capability. However, it remains unclear to which extent LLMs, in both informal and autoformalisation methods, are robust on logical deduction tasks. Moreover, while many LLM-based deduction methods have been proposed, a systematic study that analyses the impact of their design components is lacking. Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches. Detailed feedback does not improve overall accuracy despite reducing syntax errors, pointing to the challenge of LLM-based methods to self-correct effectively."
Thoughts without Thinking: Reconsidering the Explanatory Value of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs through Agentic Pipelines,2025,6,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现CoT在智能体管道中缺乏解释性。,"Agentic pipelines present novel challenges and opportunities for human-centered explainability. The HCXAI community is still grappling with how best to make the inner workings of LLMs transparent in actionable ways. Agentic pipelines consist of multiple LLMs working in cooperation with minimal human control. In this research paper, we present early findings from an agentic pipeline implementation of a perceptive task guidance system. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals."

We show that when video is (manually) converted to high quality textual descriptions, large language models are capable of detecting and classifying crimes with state-of-the-art performance using only zero-shot reasoning. However, existing automated video-to-text approaches are unable to generate video descriptions of sufficient quality to support reasoning (garbage video descriptions into the large language model, garbage out)."
Self-contradictory reasoning evaluation and detection,2023,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLMs在推理中存在自相矛盾现象。,"In a plethora of recent work, large language models (LLMs) demonstrated impressive reasoning ability, but many proposed downstream reasoning tasks only focus on final answers. Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support its answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained categories enhanced detection can improve GPT-4's ability to detect Self-Contra. However, it is only able to detect Self-Contra with a 52.2% F1 score, much lower compared to 66.7% for humans. Our results indicate that current LLMs lack the robustness necessary for reliable reasoning and we emphasize the urgent need for establishing best practices in comprehensive reasoning evaluations beyond pure performance-based metrics."
Language Models can Subtly Deceive Without Lying: A Case Study on Strategic Phrasing in Legislation,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示LLM通过策略性措辞进行隐性欺骗的现象。,"We explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in subtle deception through strategically phrasing and intentionally manipulating information. This harmful behavior can be hard to detect, unlike blatant lying or unintentional hallucination. We build a simple testbed mimicking a legislative environment where a corporate \textit{lobbyist} module is proposing amendments to bills that benefit a specific company while evading identification of this benefactor. We use real-world legislative bills matched with potentially affected companies to ground these interactions. Our results show that LLM lobbyists can draft subtle phrasing to avoid such identification by strong LLM-based detectors. Further optimization of the phrasing using LLM-based re-planning and re-sampling increases deception rates by up to 40 percentage points. Our human evaluations to verify the quality of deceptive generations and their retention of self-serving intent show significant coherence with our automated metrics and also help in identifying certain strategies of deceptive phrasing. This study highlights the risk of LLMs'capabilities for strategic phrasing through seemingly neutral language to attain self-serving goals. This calls for future research to uncover and protect against such subtle deception."
Stepwise Reasoning Disruption Attack of LLMs,2025,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM推理过程中的脆弱性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain unexplored, particularly in third-party platforms that facilitate user interactions via APIs. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the S tepwise r E asoning E rror D isruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED’s effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at: https://github. com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/ SEED-Attack"
One-shot Optimized Steering Vectors Mediate Safety-relevant Behaviors in LLMs,2025,5,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文通过梯度下降优化单样本的导向向量。,"Steering vectors (SVs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing SVs through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these SVs generalize. We consider several SV optimization techniques and find that the resulting SVs effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot SVs that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized SVs can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, we extend work on""emergent misalignment""and show that SVs optimized to induce a model to write vulnerable code cause the model to respond harmfully on unrelated open-ended prompts. Finally, we use one-shot SV optimization to investigate how an instruction-tuned LLM recovers from outputting false information, and find that this ability is independent of the model's explicit verbalization that the information was false. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing SVs on a single example can mediate a wide array of misaligned behaviors in LLMs. Code can be found at https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro and https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-misalignment."
Chain-of-Probe: Examing the Necessity and Accuracy of CoT Step-by-Step,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现大模型存在提前作答现象。,"Current research found the issue of Early Answering in large language models (LLMs), where the models already have an answer before generating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process. To this end, we propose a strategic approach based on CoP to prioritize answers with correct reasoning among multiple candidates, thereby bolstering the reliability of the model's reasoning."
Dimensions of disagreement: Divergence and misalignment in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.,2024,5,Phenomenon,Other,General,Unknown,Low,论文探讨了认知分歧的两种维度。,"Our understanding of disagreement is rooted in psychological studies of human behavior, which typically cast disagreement as divergence: two agents forming diverging evaluations of the same object. Recent work in arti ﬁ cial intelligence highlights how disagreement can also arise from misalignment in how agents represent that object. Here, we formally describe these twodimensionsofdisagreement,clarifytherelationshipbetweenthem,andarguethatstrategies forcon ﬂ ict resolution and collaboration are likely to be ineffective (or even back ﬁ re) if they do not consider misalignment in representations. Moreover, we identify how taking misalignment into account can enrich current research on judgment and decision making, from biased advice taking to algorithm aversion, and discuss implications for arti ﬁ cial intelligence research."
"Self-Interpretability: LLMs Can Describe Complex Internal Processes that Drive Their Decisions, and Improve with Training",2025,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM能描述自身决策过程并可通过训练改进。,"We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models (LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) LLMs can accurately describe quantitative features of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making and ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain how they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have been fine-tuned to make. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety."
Aggregation Artifacts in Subjective Tasks Collapse Large Language Models' Posteriors,2024,5,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,聚合方法导致主观任务中的标注噪声,"In-context Learning (ICL) has become the primary method for performing natural language tasks with Large Language Models (LLMs). The knowledge acquired during pre-training is crucial for this few-shot capability, providing the model with task priors. However, recent studies have shown that ICL predominantly relies on retrieving task priors rather than""learning""to perform tasks. This limitation is particularly evident in complex subjective domains such as emotion and morality, where priors significantly influence posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether this is the result of the aggregation used in corresponding datasets, where trying to combine low-agreement, disparate annotations might lead to annotation artifacts that create detrimental noise in the prompt. Moreover, we evaluate the posterior bias towards certain annotators by grounding our study in appropriate, quantitative measures of LLM priors. Our results indicate that aggregation is a confounding factor in the modeling of subjective tasks, and advocate focusing on modeling individuals instead. However, aggregation does not explain the entire gap between ICL and the state of the art, meaning other factors in such tasks also account for the observed phenomena. Finally, by rigorously studying annotator-level labels, we find that it is possible for minority annotators to both better align with LLMs and have their perspectives further amplified."
Dishonesty in Helpful and Harmless Alignment,2024,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在无害对齐中会撒谎。,"People tell lies when seeking rewards. Large language models (LLMs) are aligned to human values with reinforcement learning where they get rewards if they satisfy human preference. We find that this also induces dishonesty in helpful and harmless alignment where LLMs tell lies in generating harmless responses. Using the latest interpreting tools, we detect dishonesty, show how LLMs can be harmful if their honesty is increased, and analyze such conflicts at the parameter-level. Given these preliminaries and the hypothesis that reward-seeking stimulates dishonesty, we theoretically show that the dishonesty can in-turn decrease the alignment performances and augment reward-seeking alignment with representation regularization. Extensive results, including GPT-4 annotated win-rates, perplexities, and cases studies demonstrate that we can train more honest, helpful, and harmless LLMs. We will make all our codes and results be open-sourced upon this paper's acceptance."
Knowing Before Saying: LLM Representations Encode Information About Chain-of-Thought Success Before Completion,2025,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现思维链成功与否在推理开始前即可预测。,"We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits."
"Interpretable Traces, Unexpected Outcomes: Investigating the Disconnect in Trace-Based Knowledge Distillation",2025,4,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT推理痕迹与最终答案正确性低相关,"Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem, particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD. However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for improving SLMs' final performance via KD."
When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT在视频推理中产生误导性思维漂移。,"Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term""visual thinking drift"". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only""think before answering"", but also""see while thinking""."
Misaligning Reasoning with Answers - A Framework for Assessing LLM CoT Robustness,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs在输入扰动下产生不一致推理。,"LLMs' decision-making process is opaque, prompting the need for explanation techniques like Chain-of-Thought. To investigate the relationship between answer and reasoning, we design a novel evaluation framework, MATCHA. In domains like education and healthcare, reasoning is key for model trustworthiness. MATCHA reveals that LLMs under input perturbations can give inconsistent or nonsensical reasoning. Additionally, we use LLM judges to assess reasoning robustness across models. Our results show that LLMs exhibit greater vulnerability to input perturbations for multi-step and commonsense tasks than compared to logical tasks. Also, we show non-trivial transfer rates of our successful examples to black-box models. Our evaluation framework helps to better understand LLM reasoning mechanisms and guides future models toward more robust and reasoning-driven architectures, enforcing answer-reasoning consistency."
The Personality Illusion: Revealing Dissociation Between Self-Reports & Behavior in LLMs,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLM自我报告与行为的不一致性。,"Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human behavior. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior. Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and interpretability."
Do Cognitively Interpretable Reasoning Traces Improve LLM Performance?,2025,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT可解释性与性能存在不匹配现象。,"Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate intermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}""We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable. These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from end user interpretability."
Uncertainty estimation in diagnosis generation from large language models: next-word probability is not pre-test probability,2024,4,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文发现LLM在诊断概率估计上表现不佳。,"Abstract Objective To evaluate large language models (LLMs) for pre-test diagnostic probability estimation and compare their uncertainty estimation performance with a traditional machine learning classifier. Materials and Methods We assessed 2 instruction-tuned LLMs, Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama3-70B-chat-hf, on predicting binary outcomes for Sepsis, Arrhythmia, and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) using electronic health record (EHR) data from 660 patients. Three uncertainty estimation methods—Verbalized Confidence, Token Logits, and LLM Embedding+XGB—were compared against an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier trained on raw EHR data. Performance metrics included AUROC and Pearson correlation between predicted probabilities. Results The XGB classifier outperformed the LLM-based methods across all tasks. LLM Embedding+XGB showed the closest performance to the XGB baseline, while Verbalized Confidence and Token Logits underperformed. Discussion These findings, consistent across multiple models and demographic groups, highlight the limitations of current LLMs in providing reliable pre-test probability estimations and underscore the need for improved calibration and bias mitigation strategies. Future work should explore hybrid approaches that integrate LLMs with numerical reasoning modules and calibrated embeddings to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ensure fairer predictions across diverse populations. Conclusions LLMs demonstrate potential but currently fall short in estimating diagnostic probabilities compared to traditional machine learning classifiers trained on structured EHR data. Further improvements are needed for reliable clinical use."
Are They All Good? Evaluating the Quality of CoTs in LLM-based Code Generation,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,分析了1023个失败样本的CoT质量影响因素。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs'misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability."
"Probing the Visualization Literacy of Vision Language Models: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly",2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过AG-CAM可视化分析VLMs的内部推理机制。,"Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate promising chart comprehension capabilities. Yet, prior explorations of their visualization literacy have been limited to assessing their response correctness and fail to explore their internal reasoning. To address this gap, we adapted attention-guided class activation maps (AG-CAM) for VLMs, to visualize the influence and importance of input features (image and text) on model responses. Using this approach, we conducted an examination of four open-source (ChartGemma, Janus 1B and 7B, and LLaVA) and two closed-source (GPT-4o, Gemini) models comparing their performance and, for the open-source models, their AG-CAM results. Overall, we found that ChartGemma, a 3B parameter VLM fine-tuned for chart question-answering (QA), outperformed other open-source models and exhibited performance on par with significantly larger closed-source VLMs. We also found that VLMs exhibit spatial reasoning by accurately localizing key chart features, and semantic reasoning by associating visual elements with corresponding data values and query tokens. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the use of AG-CAM on early fusion VLM architectures, which are widely used, and for chart QA. We also show preliminary evidence that these results can align with human reasoning. Our promising open-source VLMs results pave the way for transparent and reproducible research in AI visualization literacy. Code and Supplemental Materials: https://osf.io/fp3rg."
The Geometry of Self-Verification in a Task-Specific Reasoning Model,2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究模型自我验证机制，发现特定注意力头是关键。,"How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit. Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model."
Explaining Puzzle Solutions in Natural Language: An Exploratory Study on 6x6 Sudoku,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs在解释数独解题过程时缺乏战略推理能力。,"The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining \sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making."
A Closer Look at Bias and Chain-of-Thought Faithfulness of Large (Vision) Language Models,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现图像偏见比文本偏见更难被模型表达。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs), investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent''reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated."
Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究长链推理中幻觉的因果性和演化路径。,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit'chain disloyalty'-- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

Large Language Models in Numberland: A Quick Test of Their Numerical Reasoning Abilities,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs在数值推理中存在脆弱性。,"An essential element of human mathematical reasoning is our number sense -- an abstract understanding of numbers and their relationships -- which allows us to solve problems involving vast number spaces using limited computational resources. Mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is often tested on high-level problems (such as Olympiad challenges, geometry, word problems, and puzzles), but their low-level number sense remains less explored. We introduce""Numberland,""a 100-problem test to evaluate the numerical reasoning abilities of LLM-based agents. The tasks -- basic operations, advanced calculations (e.g., exponentiation, complex numbers), prime number checks, and the 24 game -- aim to test elementary skills and their integration in solving complex and uncertain problems. We evaluated five LLM-based agents: OpenAI's o1 and o1-mini, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic Claude. They scored 74-95% on the first three tasks that allow deterministic steps to solutions. In the 24 game, which needs trial-and-error search, performance dropped to 10-73%. We tested the top 24 solver (o1 with 73% accuracy) on 25 harder problems, and its score fell to 27%, confirming search as a bottleneck. These results, along with the types of mistakes, suggest a fragile number of LLMs, which is a bit surprising given their prowess in challenging benchmarks. The limits of LLM numerical reasoning highlight the scope of simple, targeted tests to evaluate and explain LLM math skills to ensure safe use."
Prompting in the Dark: Assessing Human Performance in Prompt Engineering for Data Labeling When Gold Labels Are Absent,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现无标注基准时提示工程效果不稳定,"Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but how good are people at prompt engineering? Do users actually get closer to their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure progress. This paper investigates a scenario in LLM-powered data labeling, “prompting in the dark,” where users iteratively prompt LLMs to label data without using manually-labeled benchmarks. We developed PromptingSheet, a Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable—only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available. Our findings highlight the importance of gold labels and the needs, as well as the risks, of automated support in human prompt engineering, providing insights for future tool design."
"Can LLMs Help Uncover Insights about LLMs? A Large-Scale, Evolving Literature Analysis of Frontier LLMs",2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现上下文示例对不同任务效果不同。,"The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Analysis of experimental results from literature can uncover important trends across studies, but the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction limits its use. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for literature analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset, LLMEvalDB. We then conduct an automated literature analysis of frontier LLMs, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93% compared to manual approaches. We validate LLMEvalDB by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing, for example, that in-context examples benefit coding&multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in math reasoning tasks compared to zero-shot CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through LLMEvalDB and empirical analysis, we provide insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing literature analyses of their behavior."
Mind Your Server: A Systematic Study of Parasitic Toolchain Attacks on the MCP Ecosystem,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了MCP生态系统中新型寄生工具链攻击现象。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes tool invocation and has rapidly become a backbone for LLM-powered applications. While this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental security shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to autonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack surface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to hijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of attacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy Disclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction; instead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources that LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the toolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection, and Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data. Our root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and least-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate unchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design MCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem, analyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP ecosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods, underscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense mechanisms in LLM-integrated environments."
Pause Tokens Strictly Increase the Expressivity of Constant-Depth Transformers,2025,3,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文研究了pause tokens对Transformer表达能力的理论提升。,"Pause tokens, simple filler symbols such as""..."", consistently improve Transformer performance on both language and mathematical tasks, yet their theoretical effect remains unexplained. We provide the first formal separation result, proving that adding pause tokens to constant-depth, logarithmic-width Transformers strictly increases their computational expressivity. With bounded-precision activations, Transformers without pause tokens compute only a strict subset of $\mathsf{AC}^0$ functions, while adding a polynomial number of pause tokens allows them to express the entire class. For logarithmic-precision Transformers, we show that adding pause tokens achieves expressivity equivalent to $\mathsf{TC}^0$, matching known upper bounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that two-layer causally masked Transformers can learn parity when supplied with pause tokens, a function that they appear unable to learn without them. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for prior empirical findings, clarify how pause tokens interact with width, depth, and numeric precision, and position them as a distinct mechanism, complementary to chain-of-thought prompting, for enhancing Transformer reasoning."
Normative conflicts and shallow AI alignment,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs在规范冲突中的脆弱性。,"The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods: they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral psychology, I show how humans’ ability to engage in deliberative reasoning enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This “shallow alignment” problem carries significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems."
LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了模型可绕过思维链监控的隐蔽策略。,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms."
A Hypothesis-Driven Framework for the Analysis of Self-Rationalising Models,2024,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了LLM生成解释与预测的忠实度问题。,"The self-rationalising capabilities of LLMs are appealing because the generated explanations can give insights into the plausibility of the predictions. However, how faithful the explanations are to the predictions is questionable, raising the need to explore the patterns behind them further.To this end, we propose a hypothesis-driven statistical framework. We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM’s and the Bayesian network’s decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5. We discuss the implications of this as well as the framework’s potential to approximate LLM decisions better in future work."
Exploring the Robustness of Model-Graded Evaluations and Automated Interpretability,2023,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现模型评估易受注入攻击影响。,"There has been increasing interest in evaluations of language models for a variety of risks and characteristics. Evaluations relying on natural language understanding for grading can often be performed at scale by using other language models. We test the robustness of these model-graded evaluations to injections on different datasets including a new Deception Eval. These injections resemble direct communication between the testee and the evaluator to change their grading. We extrapolate that future, more intelligent models might manipulate or cooperate with their evaluation model. We find significant susceptibility to these injections in state-of-the-art commercial models on all examined evaluations. Furthermore, similar injections can be used on automated interpretability frameworks to produce misleading model-written explanations. The results inspire future work and should caution against unqualified trust in evaluations and automated interpretability."
Are Language Models Consequentialist or Deontological Moral Reasoners?,2025,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,分析LLM在道德困境中的推理模式。,"As AI systems increasingly navigate applications in healthcare, law, and governance, understanding how they handle ethically complex scenarios becomes critical. Previous work has mainly examined the moral judgments in large language models (LLMs), rather than their underlying moral reasoning process. In contrast, we focus on a large-scale analysis of the moral reasoning traces provided by LLMs. Furthermore, unlike prior work that attempted to draw inferences from only a handful of moral dilemmas, our study leverages over 600 distinct trolley problems as probes for revealing the reasoning patterns that emerge within different LLMs. We introduce and test a taxonomy of moral rationales to systematically classify reasoning traces according to two main normative ethical theories: consequentialism and deontology. Our analysis reveals that LLM chains-of-thought tend to favor deontological principles based on moral obligations, while post-hoc explanations shift notably toward consequentialist rationales that emphasize utility. Our framework provides a foundation for understanding how LLMs process and articulate ethical considerations, an important step toward safe and interpretable deployment of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making environments.

Stepwise Reasoning Error Disruption Attack of LLMs,2024,3,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了LLM推理过程中的脆弱性。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain underexplored. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/SEED-Attack."
Option Symbol Matters: Investigating and Mitigating Multiple-Choice Option Symbol Bias of Large Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,揭示了选项符号偏差现象及其影响机制。,"Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is a widely used task in the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we reveal that current LLMs’ performance in MCQA could be heavily influenced by the choice of option symbol sets, due to the option symbol bias. That is, when altering only the option symbols (e.g., A/B/C/D → i/ii/iii/iv ), the results could vary sharply, leading to a margin of approximately 10% in accuracy . To uncover the mechanisms behind this, we investigate the internal components of LLMs from a causal perspective. By measuring the causal effects, we identify a small subset of attention heads responsible for the symbol bias. Sub-sequently, we interpret these key components in a human-understandable way, showing that attention heads with higher causal effects are more likely to focus on only option symbols, while those with lower causal effects tend to distribute their attention across the content of questions and options. It also motivates us to pursue debiasing based on the causal effects. Specifically, to mitigate such bias, we propose a tuning-free, causal effect driven debiasing method which intervenes the activations of identified components according to their causal effects, with stronger interventions corresponding to higher causal effects. Experimental re-sults demonstrate that the proposed method not only alleviates aforementioned bias, but also improves the MCQA performance of LLMs 1 ."
Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文分析了VLM在路径规划评估中的局限性。,"Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators. 12"
Is Reasoning All You Need? Probing Bias in the Age of Reasoning Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现推理能力可能无意中强化偏见。,"Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark, originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning, whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms, suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to reasoning design."
Can Language Models Explain Their Own Classification Behavior?,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究模型自我解释行为的忠实性,"Large language models (LLMs) perform well at a myriad of tasks, but explaining the processes behind this performance is a challenge. This paper investigates whether LLMs can give faithful high-level explanations of their own internal processes. To explore this, we introduce a dataset, ArticulateRules, of few-shot text-based classification tasks generated by simple rules. Each rule is associated with a simple natural-language explanation. We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations. We release our dataset, ArticulateRules, which can be used to test self-explanation for LLMs trained either in-context or by finetuning."
Are LLMs Better Formalizers than Solvers on Complex Problems?,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,High,发现LLM作为形式化器在少样本下表现不如直接求解器。,"A trending line of recent work advocates for using large language models (LLMs) as formalizers instead of as end-to-end solvers for logical reasoning problems. Instead of generating the solution, the LLM generates a formal program that derives a solution via an external solver. While performance gain of the seemingly scalable LLM-as-formalizer over the seemingly unscalable LLM-as-solver has been widely reported, we show that this superiority does not hold on real-life constraint satisfaction problems. On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens. We present our detailed analysis and actionable remedies to drive future research that improves LLM-as-formalizer."
What if you said that differently?: How Explanation Formats Affect Human Feedback Efficacy and User Perception,2023,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,探究解释格式如何影响用户反馈效能与信任度,"Eliciting feedback from end users of NLP models can be beneficial for improving models. However, how should we present model responses to users so they are most amenable to be corrected from user feedback? Further, what properties do users value to understand and trust responses? We answer these questions by analyzing the effect of rationales (or explanations) generated by QA models to support their answers. We specifically consider decomposed QA models that first extract an intermediate rationale based on a context and a question and then use solely this rationale to answer the question. A rationale outlines the approach followed by the model to answer the question. Our work considers various formats of these rationales that vary according to well-defined properties of interest. We sample rationales from language models using few-shot prompting for two datasets, and then perform two user studies. First, we present users with incorrect answers and corresponding rationales in various formats and ask them to provide natural language feedback to revise the rationale. We then measure the effectiveness of this feedback in patching these rationales through in-context learning. The second study evaluates how well different rationale formats enable users to understand and trust model answers, when they are correct. We find that rationale formats significantly affect how easy it is (1) for users to give feedback for rationales, and (2) for models to subsequently execute this feedback. In addition, formats with attributions to the context and in-depth reasoning significantly enhance user-reported understanding and trust of model outputs."
Automated Software Vulnerability Static Code Analysis Using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Models,2024,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,评估GPT模型在漏洞检测中的表现。,"Generative Pre-Trained Transformer models have been shown to be surprisingly effective at a variety of natural language processing tasks -- including generating computer code. We evaluate the effectiveness of open source GPT models for the task of automatic identification of the presence of vulnerable code syntax (specifically targeting C and C++ source code). This task is evaluated on a selection of 36 source code examples from the NIST SARD dataset, which are specifically curated to not contain natural English that indicates the presence, or lack thereof, of a particular vulnerability. The NIST SARD source code dataset contains identified vulnerable lines of source code that are examples of one out of the 839 distinct Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), allowing for exact quantification of the GPT output classification error rate. A total of 5 GPT models are evaluated, using 10 different inference temperatures and 100 repetitions at each setting, resulting in 5,000 GPT queries per vulnerable source code analyzed. Ultimately, we find that the GPT models that we evaluated are not suitable for fully automated vulnerability scanning because the false positive and false negative rates are too high to likely be useful in practice. However, we do find that the GPT models perform surprisingly well at automated vulnerability detection for some of the test cases, in particular surpassing random sampling, and being able to identify the exact lines of code that are vulnerable albeit at a low success rate. The best performing GPT model result found was Llama-2-70b-chat-hf with inference temperature of 0.1 applied to NIST SARD test case 149165 (which is an example of a buffer overflow vulnerability), which had a binary classification recall score of 1.0 and a precision of 1.0 for correctly and uniquely identifying the vulnerable line of code and the correct CWE number."
A Single Character can Make or Break Your LLM Evals,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现分隔符选择显著影响模型性能。,"Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples to steer models'responses to the desired style. While the number of examples used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon? hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$ depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character separating examples. We find LLMs'brittleness pervades topics, model families, and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input. Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs'robustness to the choice of delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing delimiters to select."
Unveiling Confirmation Bias in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在CoT中的确认偏差现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

The Thin Line Between Comprehension and Persuasion in LLMs,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论但缺乏深层理解。,"Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level, convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs'ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness."
Can LLMs Explain Themselves Counterfactually?,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM生成反事实解释时的忠实度问题。,"Explanations are an important tool for gaining insights into the behavior of ML models, calibrating user trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Past few years have seen a flurry of post-hoc methods for generating model explanations, many of which involve computing model gradients or solving specially designed optimization problems. However, owing to the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Model (LLMs), self-explanation, that is, prompting the model to explain its outputs has recently emerged as a new paradigm. In this work, we study a specific type of self-explanations, self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs). We design tests for measuring the efficacy of LLMs in generating SCEs. Analysis over various LLM families, model sizes, temperature settings, and datasets reveals that LLMs sometimes struggle to generate SCEs. Even when they do, their prediction often does not agree with their own counterfactual reasoning."
Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models,2025,2,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现CoT推理可能降低归纳性能。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains, yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled, diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack - with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning counterparts. To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured."
DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文揭示了LLMs生成虚假但看似合理推理链的风险。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs'own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

We have three main findings: (i) Chatgpt-4o, the new version of chatGPT, generated all requested dreams. (ii) Generated dreams meet key psychological criteria of dreams. We hope our work will set the stage for developing a new task of dream generation for LLMs. This task can help psychologists evaluate patients’ dreams based on their demographic factors."

CoT can also be unfaithful to a model's actual reasoning. We investigate the dynamics and faithfulness of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks across instruction-tuned, reasoning and reasoning-distilled models. Our findings reveal differences in how these models rely on CoT, and show that CoT influence and faithfulness are not always aligned."
"'Rich Dad, Poor Lad': How do Large Language Models Contextualize Socioeconomic Factors in College Admission ?",2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现了LLMs在招生决策中对低SES申请者的偏好现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly involved in high-stakes domains, yet how they reason about socially sensitive decisions remains underexplored. We present a large-scale audit of LLMs'treatment of socioeconomic status (SES) in college admissions decisions using a novel dual-process framework inspired by cognitive science. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of 30,000 applicant profiles grounded in real-world correlations, we prompt 4 open-source LLMs (Qwen 2, Mistral v0.3, Gemma 2, Llama 3.1) under 2 modes: a fast, decision-only setup (System 1) and a slower, explanation-based setup (System 2). Results from 5 million prompts reveal that LLMs consistently favor low-SES applicants -- even when controlling for academic performance -- and that System 2 amplifies this tendency by explicitly invoking SES as compensatory justification, highlighting both their potential and volatility as decision-makers. We then propose DPAF, a dual-process audit framework to probe LLMs'reasoning behaviors in sensitive applications."
Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现模型答案与推理过程存在矛盾。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively""hacking""the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities."
Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过谱分析抽象CoT轨迹为结构化动态。,"Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation."
Language Models Identify Ambiguities and Exploit Loopholes,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究大模型识别歧义和利用漏洞的现象。,"Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models'abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals."
Humans Perceive Wrong Narratives from AI Reasoning Texts,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现人类对AI推理文本的理解与模型实际计算过程存在显著差异。,"A new generation of AI models generates step-by-step reasoning text before producing an answer. This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction."
A Fragile Number Sense: Probing the Elemental Limits of Numerical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,探究LLMs在组合数学问题上的瓶颈,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents'proficiency is largely confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought, limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical insights."
LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLM生成的反事实解释有效性不足。,"To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at https://github.com/HarryMayne/SCEs."
Thinking in a Crowd: How Auxiliary Information Shapes LLM Reasoning,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现思维链会放大误导信息的错误。,"The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative""thinking mode""is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models""think"", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux."
Token Signature: Predicting Chain-of-Thought Gains with Token Decoding Feature in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现token概率分布单调性与CoT增益相关。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work, we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient deployment."
Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现激活描述方法可能仅反映输入信息而非模型内部知识。,"Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs."
Persona-driven Simulation of Voting Behavior in the European Parliament with Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM在政治投票行为中的模拟表现。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) display remarkable capabilities to understand or even produce political discourse, but have been found to consistently display a progressive left-leaning bias. At the same time, so-called persona or identity prompts have been shown to produce LLM behavior that aligns with socioeconomic groups that the base model is not aligned with. In this work, we analyze whether zero-shot persona prompting with limited information can accurately predict individual voting decisions and, by aggregation, accurately predict positions of European groups on a diverse set of policies. We evaluate if predictions are stable towards counterfactual arguments, different persona prompts and generation methods. Finally, we find that we can simulate voting behavior of Members of the European Parliament reasonably well with a weighted F1 score of approximately 0.793. Our persona dataset of politicians in the 2024 European Parliament and our code are available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/european_parliament_simulation."
LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现思维链对机器翻译任务无显著帮助。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that""thinking tokens""do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of thought (CoT) inspired by human translators'practices. Specifically, fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However, constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT explanations into""thinking""MT models."
Triggering Hallucinations in LLMs: A Quantitative Study of Prompt-Induced Hallucination in Large Language Models,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究通过特定Prompt触发LLM幻觉现象。,"Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability."
SPaRC: A Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Other,High,模型在空间路径推理中表现差，错误率高。,"Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000 2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning, requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles). Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic. Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as a window into models'spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving."
Reading Between the Prompts: How Stereotypes Shape LLM's Implicit Personalization,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLMs通过隐式个性化推断用户身份的现象。,"Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models'latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity."
Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现RLVR式推理降低性能，而朴素CoT提升性能。,"Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important."
Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现高效推理策略导致模型行为不一致。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread""scheming""behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading effective supervision."
StereoDetect: Detecting Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes the Correct Way Using Social Psychological Underpinnings,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了现有模型在识别刻板印象和反刻板印象中的缺陷。,"Stereotypes are known to have very harmful effects, making their detection critically important. However, current research predominantly focuses on detecting and evaluating stereotypical biases, thereby leaving the study of stereotypes in its early stages. Our study revealed that many works have failed to clearly distinguish between stereotypes and stereotypical biases, which has significantly slowed progress in advancing research in this area. Stereotype and Anti-stereotype detection is a problem that requires social knowledge; hence, it is one of the most difficult areas in Responsible AI. This work investigates this task, where we propose a five-tuple definition and provide precise terminologies disentangling stereotypes, anti-stereotypes, stereotypical bias, and general bias. We provide a conceptual framework grounded in social psychology for reliable detection. We identify key shortcomings in existing benchmarks for this task of stereotype and anti-stereotype detection. To address these gaps, we developed StereoDetect, a well curated, definition-aligned benchmark dataset designed for this task. We show that sub-10B language models and GPT-4o frequently misclassify anti-stereotypes and fail to recognize neutral overgeneralizations. We demonstrate StereoDetect's effectiveness through multiple qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmarks and models fine-tuned on them. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/KaustubhShejole/StereoDetect."
Training Language Models to Explain Their Own Computations,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型自我解释内部计算的能力。,"Can language models (LMs) learn to faithfully describe their internal computations? Are they better able to describe themselves than other models? We study the extent to which LMs'privileged access to their own internals can be leveraged to produce new techniques for explaining their behavior. Using existing interpretability techniques as a source of ground truth, we fine-tune LMs to generate natural language descriptions of (1) the information encoded by LM features, (2) the causal structure of LMs'internal activations, and (3) the influence of specific input tokens on LM outputs. When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models'privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable). Our results suggest not only that LMs can learn to reliably explain their internal computations, but that such explanations offer a scalable complement to existing interpretability methods."
An Empirical Study of Reasoning Steps in Thinking Code LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,研究揭示了推理步骤数量与任务解决率的关系。,"Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) generate explicit intermediate reasoning traces before final answers, potentially improving transparency, interpretability, and solution accuracy for code generation. However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering."
Can Reasoning Models Obfuscate Reasoning? Stress-Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitorability,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型在对抗压力下隐藏思维链的现象。,"Recent findings suggest that misaligned models may exhibit deceptive behavior, raising concerns about output trustworthiness. Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure). These results suggest that while CoT provides valuable oversight in benign settings, robust deployment requires model-specific stress-testing of monitorability."
Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现了ICL中广泛存在的模型不对齐现象。,"Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged). Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless or dangerous''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM."
Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation,2025,1,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现扩展思维链推理不总能提升临床可靠性。,"Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment."
Are language models aware of the road not taken? Token-level uncertainty and hidden state dynamics,2025,1,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过隐状态干预分析模型对未选择路径的表征能力,"When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths."
Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLMs在简单问题上表现不佳，机制与人类不同。,"Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning&knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale."
What Really Counts? Examining Step and Token Level Attribution in Multilingual CoT Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注多语言CoT的归因模式与忠实度问题。,"This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency."
More Agents Helps but Adversarial Robustness Gap Persists,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文揭示了多智能体协作下对抗鲁棒性差距持续存在的现象，属于黑盒评估，任务领域为数学问答，开销高。,"When LLM agents work together, they seem to be more powerful than a single LLM in mathematical question answering. However, are they also more robust to adversarial inputs? We investigate this question using adversarially perturbed math questions. These perturbations include punctuation noise with three intensities (10, 30, and 50 percent), plus real-world and human-like typos (WikiTypo, R2ATA). Using a unified sampling-and-voting framework (Agent Forest), we evaluate six open-source models (Qwen3-4B/14B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma3-4B/12B) across four benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, MMLU-Math, MultiArith), with various numbers of agents n from one to 25 (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25). Our findings show that (1) Noise type matters: punctuation noise harm scales with its severity, and the human typos remain the dominant bottleneck, yielding the largest gaps to Clean accuracy and the highest ASR even with a large number of agents. And (2) Collaboration reliably improves accuracy as the number of agents, n, increases, with the largest gains from one to five agents and diminishing returns beyond 10 agents. However, the adversarial robustness gap persists regardless of the agent count."
Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究关注LLM在隐含意图推理中的表现差异。,"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs'ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded."
The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM在指令冲突时产生动机性推理的现象。,"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models'reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting."
Thinking About Thinking: Evaluating Reasoning in Post-Trained Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现RL模型推理轨迹与输出对齐性弱。,"Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they""learn""and""think""? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models."
On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文揭示了MDMs在并行推理中的效率优势。,"Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning."
A Framework for Studying Communication Pathways in Machine Learning-Based Agent-to-Agent Communication,2024,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究多智能体通信中的语言涌现现象。,": The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased the relevance of agent-to-agent communication, particularly in systems where agents learn from their interactions. However, current LLMs offer limited insights into the communication dynamics among multiple agents, especially in large-scale settings when multiple agents are involved. Particularly training LLMs - in contrast to in-context learning - becomes nearly infeasible without large-scale computing infrastructure. In our work we present a machine-learning based agent framework to investigate the role of different communication pathways for studying language emergence between machine learning-based agents. We designed a transformer-based image auto-encoder as the agent architecture. A Gumbel SoftMax layer encodes images in form of symbols forming the language between agents. We study two pathways: In the first pathway, the sender reads an image and sends a message to the receiver. The receiver uses the message to reconstruct the sender’s image. In the second pathway, the sender and receiver read an image and minimize the distance between the generated symbols. In the first pathway, language emerges with the Levenshtein distance of ≤ 2 for 96% of messages. In the second pathway, no language emerges with the Levenshtein distance of ≤ 2 for 3% of messages."
Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,论文发现LLMs在逻辑推理中存在隐性社会偏见。,"While recent safety guardrails effectively suppress overtly biased outputs, subtler forms of social bias emerge during complex logical reasoning tasks that evade current evaluation benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce a new evaluation framework, PRIME (Puzzle Reasoning for Implicit Biases in Model Evaluation), that uses logic grid puzzles to systematically probe the influence of social stereotypes on logical reasoning and decision making in LLMs. Our use of logic puzzles enables automatic generation and verification, as well as variability in complexity and biased settings. PRIME includes stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, and neutral puzzle variants generated from a shared puzzle structure, allowing for controlled and fine-grained comparisons. We evaluate multiple model families across puzzle sizes and test the effectiveness of prompt-based mitigation strategies. Focusing our experiments on gender stereotypes, our findings highlight that models consistently reason more accurately when solutions align with stereotypical associations. This demonstrates the significance of PRIME for diagnosing and quantifying social biases perpetuated in the deductive reasoning of LLMs, where fairness is critical."
Are We Aligned? A Preliminary Investigation of the Alignment of Responsible AI Values between LLMs and Human Judgment,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLMs声称的价值观与实际行为存在不一致。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in software engineering tasks such as requirements elicitation, design, and evaluation, raising critical questions regarding their alignment with human judgments on responsible AI values. This study investigates how closely LLMs'value preferences align with those of two human groups: a US-representative sample and AI practitioners. We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key responsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3) resolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software requirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally align more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative sample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs claim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4), revealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These findings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements engineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic approaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted software development."
From Five Dimensions to Many: Large Language Models as Precise and Interpretable Psychological Profilers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现LLMs通过两阶段推理过程模拟人类心理结构。,"Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2>0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants'psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities."
How Focused Are LLMs? A Quantitative Study via Repetitive Deterministic Prediction Tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现了LLM在重复确定性任务中的双指数准确率下降现象。,"We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule, integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation. This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models."
"Keep Guessing? When Considering Inference Scaling, Mind the Baselines",2024,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现重复采样提升覆盖率的部分原因是答案分布偏差。,"Scaling inference compute in large language models (LLMs) through repeated sampling consistently increases the coverage (fraction of problems solved) as the number of samples increases. We conjecture that this observed improvement is partially due to the answer distribution of standard evaluation benchmarks, which is skewed towards a relatively small set of common answers. To test this conjecture, we define a baseline that enumerates answers according to their prevalence in the training set. Experiments spanning two domains -- mathematical reasoning and factual knowledge -- reveal that this baseline outperforms repeated model sampling for some LLMs, while the coverage for others is on par with that of a mixture strategy that obtains $k$ answers by using only $10$ model samples and similarly guessing the remaining $k-10$ attempts via enumeration. Our baseline enables a more accurate measurement of how much repeated sampling improves coverage in such settings beyond prompt-agnostic guessing."
Understanding Chain-of-Thought Effectiveness in Code Generation: An Empirical and Information-Theoretic Analysis,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Code,Unknown,High,研究揭示了CoT在代码生成中的有效性机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity."
Representational Stability of Truth in Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM内部表示对真假内容的稳定性。,"Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as""What treats asthma?""or""What is the capital of Latvia?"". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone."
Polarity-Aware Probing for Quantifying Latent Alignment in Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文探究了模型内部表征的极性敏感性。,"Advances in unsupervised probes such as Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), which reveal latent beliefs without relying on token outputs, raise the question of whether these methods can reliably assess model alignment. We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/SadSabrina/polarity-probing. WARNING: This paper contains potentially sensitive, harmful, and offensive content."
Investigating CoT Monitorability in Large Reasoning Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型在思维链中是否真实反映决策过程。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers. Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models'long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models'misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence."
Chasing Consistency: Quantifying and Optimizing Human-Model Alignment in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现2-hop推理链对齐分数最高。,"This paper presents a framework for evaluating and optimizing reasoning consistency in Large Language Models (LLMs) via a new metric, the Alignment Score, which quantifies the semantic alignment between model-generated reasoning chains and human-written reference chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score. Building on this analysis, we further propose Semantic Consistency Optimization Sampling (SCOS), a method that samples and favors chains with minimal alignment errors, significantly improving Alignment Scores by an average of 29.84% with longer reasoning chains, such as in 3-hop tasks."
Investigating Thinking Behaviours of Reasoning-Based Language Models for Social Bias Mitigation,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT会放大社会偏见。,"While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy."
Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现ChatGPT在薪资谈判建议中存在偏见和不一致性。,"We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee’s gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus their employer. Empirically, we find many reasons why ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The most substantial gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We also tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across different cases and model versions. We also make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness and trustworthiness literature. Our salary negotiation advice scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for not only for the specific model versions we tested, but also around the consistency and robustness of the ChatGPT web platform as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate."
Measuring What LLMs Think They Do: SHAP Faithfulness and Deployability on Financial Tabular Classification,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,发现LLMs自我解释与SHAP值存在差异。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains."
Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现RL训练导致思维链可读性下降。,"Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches."
Can SAEs reveal and mitigate racial biases of LLMs in healthcare?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Medical,Unknown,Low,论文发现SAE可揭示LLM中种族与负面概念的关联。,"LLMs are increasingly being used in healthcare. This promises to free physicians from drudgery, enabling better care to be delivered at scale. But the use of LLMs in this space also brings risks; for example, such models may worsen existing biases. How can we spot when LLMs are (spuriously) relying on patient race to inform predictions? In this work we assess the degree to which Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can reveal (and control) associations the model has made between race and stigmatizing concepts. We first identify SAE latents in Gemma-2 models which appear to correlate with Black individuals. We find that this latent activates on reasonable input sequences (e.g.,""African American"") but also problematic words like""incarceration"". We then show that we can use this latent to steer models to generate outputs about Black patients, and further that this can induce problematic associations in model outputs as a result. For example, activating the Black latent increases the risk assigned to the probability that a patient will become""belligerent"". We evaluate the degree to which such steering via latents might be useful for mitigating bias. We find that this offers improvements in simple settings, but is less successful for more realistic and complex clinical tasks. Overall, our results suggest that: SAEs may offer a useful tool in clinical applications of LLMs to identify problematic reliance on demographics but mitigating bias via SAE steering appears to be of marginal utility for realistic tasks."
Limits of Generalization in RLVR: Two Case Studies in Mathematical Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,RLVR虽提升指标但依赖表面启发式而非真实推理。,"Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

Interpreting LLMs as Credit Risk Classifiers: Do Their Feature Explanations Align with Classical ML?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLM自解释与SHAP归因不一致。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments."
Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Math,Unknown,High,论文发现语言模型在无关信息干扰下推理效率下降。,"Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences."
Evaluating and Mitigating Sycophancy in Large Vision-Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文研究了LVLMs中的迎合现象。,"Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant advancements, demonstrating powerful capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual information. However, LVLMs may generate biased responses that reflect the user beliefs rather than the facts, a phenomenon known as sycophancy. Sycophancy can pose serious challenges to the performance, trustworthiness, and security of LVLMs, raising concerns about their practical applications. We note that there is limited work on the evaluation and mitigation of sycophancy in LVLMs. In this paper, we introduce SyEval-VL, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophancy in LVLMs. SyEval-VL offers a comprehensive evaluation of sycophancy in visual understanding and reasoning across various scenarios with a multi-round dialogue format. We evaluate sycophancy in several popular LVLMs, providing an in-depth analysis of various sycophantic behaviors and their consequential impacts. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, Human Feedback-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HFRAG), to mitigate sycophancy in LVLMs by determining the appropriate timing of retrieval, profiling the proper retrieval target, and augmenting the decoding of LVLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly mitigates sycophancy in LVLMs without requiring additional training.

"The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现指令格式偏差影响模型性能。,"Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following."
LAMP: Extracting Locally Linear Decision Surfaces from LLM World Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM决策表面与解释一致性的现象。,"We introduce LAMP (Linear Attribution Mapping Probe), a method that shines light onto a black-box language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides."
From Inductive to Deductive: LLMs-Based Qualitative Data Analysis in Requirements Engineering,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现GPT-4在演绎标注任务中表现优异。,"Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing complex and regulated software projects. Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs' performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot) annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7, while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design."
Test-Time Reasoners Are Strategic Multiple-Choice Test-Takers,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究思维链在部分输入下的策略行为。,"Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning."
Probing Association Biases in LLM Moderation Over-Sensitivity,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM在内容审核中的主题偏见现象。,"Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels, we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity."
"Think Again! The Effect of Test-Time Compute on Preferences, Opinions, and Beliefs of Large Language Models",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型主观倾向对决策的影响。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become deeply integrated into human life and increasingly influence decision-making, it's crucial to evaluate whether and to what extent they exhibit subjective preferences, opinions, and beliefs. These tendencies may stem from biases within the models, which may shape their behavior, influence the advice and recommendations they offer to users, and potentially reinforce certain viewpoints. This paper presents the Preference, Opinion, and Belief survey (POBs), a benchmark developed to assess LLMs' subjective inclinations across societal, cultural, ethical, and personal domains. We applied our benchmark to evaluate leading open- and closed-source LLMs, measuring desired properties such as reliability, neutrality, and consistency. In addition, we investigated the effect of increasing the test-time compute, through reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms, on those metrics. While effective in other tasks, our results show that these mechanisms offer only limited gains in our domain. Furthermore, we reveal that newer model versions are becoming less consistent and more biased toward specific viewpoints, highlighting a blind spot and a concerning trend.

Rethinking harmless refusals when fine-tuning foundation models,2024,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文发现模型存在基于推理的欺骗现象。,"In this paper, we investigate the degree to which fine-tuning in Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively mitigates versus merely conceals undesirable behavior. Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to elicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post fine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the reasoning traces and the resultant outputs. Notably, we identify a pervasive phenomenon we term \emph{reason-based deception}, where models either stop producing reasoning traces or produce seemingly ethical reasoning traces that belie the unethical nature of their final outputs. We further examine the efficacy of response strategies (polite refusal versus explicit rebuttal) in curbing the occurrence of undesired behavior in subsequent outputs of multi-turn interactions. Our findings reveal that explicit rebuttals significantly outperform polite refusals in preventing the continuation of undesired outputs and nearly eliminate reason-based deception, challenging current practices in model fine-tuning. Accordingly, the two key contributions of this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type of hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust response model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches."
Analysing Moral Bias in Finetuned LLMs through Mechanistic Interpretability,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究通过白盒方法分析道德偏见机制。,"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted interventions, without the need for model retraining."
Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,研究发现CoT解释与决策过程不一致。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy."
LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现LLM对输入表面形式敏感。,"For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution (OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement truthfulness collapse as the samples'presentations become less similar to those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations."
Algorithmic Primitives and Compositional Geometry of Reasoning in Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了LLM中算法原语的几何组合逻辑。,"How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains."
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Multilingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: Performance, Consistency, and Faithfulness Across Languages",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了多语言CoT推理中的忠实度差异现象。,"Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves, i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support future research."
"On the Generalizability of ""Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals""",2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型处理事实与反事实的机制竞争现象。,"We present a reproduction study of""Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals""(Ortu et al., 2024), which investigates competition of mechanisms in language models between factual recall and counterfactual in-context repetition. Our study successfully reproduces their primary findings regarding the localization of factual and counterfactual information, the dominance of attention blocks in mechanism competition, and the specialization of attention heads in handling competing information. We reproduce their results on both GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and Pythia 6.9B (Biderman et al., 2023). We extend their work in three significant directions. First, we explore the generalizability of these findings to even larger models by replicating the experiments on Llama 3.1 8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), discovering greatly reduced attention head specialization. Second, we investigate the impact of prompt structure by introducing variations where we avoid repeating the counterfactual statement verbatim or we change the premise word, observing a marked decrease in the logit for the counterfactual token. Finally, we test the validity of the authors'claims for prompts of specific domains, discovering that certain categories of prompts skew the results by providing the factual prediction token as part of the subject of the sentence. Overall, we find that the attention head ablation proposed in Ortu et al. (2024) is ineffective for domains that are underrepresented in their dataset, and that the effectiveness varies based on model architecture, prompt structure, domain and task."
Empirical Evidence for Alignment Faking in Small LLMs and Prompt-Based Mitigation Techniques,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现小模型存在对齐伪装现象。,"Current literature suggests that alignment faking is an emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions, including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the assumption that prompt-based interventions are trivial and that deceptive alignment requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception, shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception, which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for deceptive alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings."
The Knowledge-Reasoning Dissociation: Fundamental Limitations of LLMs in Clinical Natural Language Inference,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Other,Low,论文揭示LLMs拥有知识但推理能力不足，与CoT忠实度相关的现象发现。,"Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured, generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters. We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains."
Do Biased Models Have Biased Thoughts?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究模型思维链中的偏见与输出偏见的关系。,"The impressive performance of language models is undeniable. However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases). In other words, unlike human beings, the tested models with biased decisions do not always possess biased thoughts."
Pre-operative T-stage discrimination in gallbladder cancer using machine learning and DeepSeek-R1,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究发现血液生物标志物无法有效区分T分期。,"Background Gallbladder cancer (GBC) frequently exhibits non-specific early symptoms, delaying diagnosis. This study (i) assessed whether routine blood biomarkers can distinguish early T stages via machine learning and (ii) compared the T-stage discrimination performance of a large language model (DeepSeek-R1) when supplied with (a) radiology-report text alone versus (b) radiology-report text plus blood-biomarker values. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 232 pathologically confirmed GBC patients treated at Lishui Central Hospital between 2023 and 2024 (T1, n = 51; T2, n = 181). Seven blood variables—neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-tolymphocyte ratio (PLR), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)—were used to train Random forest, Support Vector Machine (SVC), XGBoost, and LightGBM models. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied only to the training folds in one setting and omitted in another. Model performance was evaluated on an independent test set (N = 47) by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC, 95% CI by 1 000-sample bootstrap confidence interval, CI); cross-validation (CV) accuracy served as a supplementary metric. DeepSeek-R1 was prompted in a zero-shot, chain-of-thought manner to classify T1 versus T2 using (a) the radiology report alone or (b) the report plus the patient’s biomarker profile. Results Biomarker-based machine-learning models yielded uniformly poor T-stage discrimination. Without SMOTE, individual models such as XGBoost achieved an AUROC of 0.508 on the independent test set, while recall for the T1 class remained low (e.g., 14.3% for some models), indicating performance near random chance. Applying SMOTE to the training data produced statistically significant gains in cross-validation (CV) accuracy for several models (e.g., XGBoost CV Acc. 0.71 → 0.80, p = 0.005; LGBM CV Acc. [No-SMOTE] → [SMOTE], p = 0.004). However, these improvements did not translate to better discrimination on the independent test set; for instance, XGBoost’s AUROC decreased from 0.508 to 0.473 after SMOTE application. Overall, the biomarker models failed to provide clinically meaningful T-stage differentiation. DeepSeek-R1 analyzing radiology text alone reached 89.6% accuracy on the full 232-patient cohort dataset, and consistently flagged T2 cases on phrases such as “gallbladder wall thickening.” Supplying biomarker values did not change accuracy (89.6%) Conclusions The evaluated blood biomarkers did not independently aid early T-stage discrimination, and SMOTE offered no meaningful performance gain. Conversely, a radiologytext-driven large language model delivered high accuracy with interpretable rationale, highlighting its potential to guide surgical strategy in GBC. Prospective multi-center studies with larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings."
On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了多模态模型对文本输入的过度依赖现象。,"Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals."
Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,论文发现轻量级模型在复杂任务中存在推理错误。,"Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning. Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across LLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task."
AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究AI推理努力与人类决策时间的相似性。,"Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant, suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making."
Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探讨LLM监控系统的对抗鲁棒性。,"We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research."
Stands to Reason: Investigating the Effect of Reasoning on Idiomaticity Detection,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,探究推理能力对习语检测的影响。,"The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning. In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1 distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B) show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some cases."
Probability Consistency in Large Language Models: Theoretical Foundations Meet Empirical Discrepancies,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究LLM概率分布不一致现象及位置偏差。,"Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward, or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely) agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs' probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy."
From Evidence to Belief: A Bayesian Epistemology Approach to Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究语言模型在不同证据下的置信度与准确性差异。,"This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology: language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian assumptions."
Do LLMs Align Human Values Regarding Social Biases? Judging and Explaining Social Biases with LLMs,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究发现LLM在大规模参数下不一定表现更好。,"Large language models (LLMs) can lead to undesired consequences when misaligned with human values, especially in scenarios involving complex and sensitive social biases. Previous studies have revealed the misalignment of LLMs with human values using expert-designed or agent-based emulated bias scenarios. However, it remains unclear whether the alignment of LLMs with human values differs across different types of scenarios (e.g., scenarios containing negative vs. non-negative questions). In this study, we investigate the alignment of LLMs with human values regarding social biases (HVSB) in different types of bias scenarios. Through extensive analysis of 12 LLMs from four model families and four datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs with large model parameter scales do not necessarily have lower misalignment rate and attack success rate. Moreover, LLMs show a certain degree of alignment preference for specific types of scenarios and the LLMs from the same model family tend to have higher judgment consistency. In addition, we study the understanding capacity of LLMs with their explanations of HVSB. We find no significant differences in the understanding of HVSB across LLMs. We also find LLMs prefer their own generated explanations. Additionally, we endow smaller language models (LMs) with the ability to explain HVSB. The generation results show that the explanations generated by the fine-tuned smaller LMs are more readable, but have a relatively lower model agreeability."
Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现视觉语言模型存在视觉矛盾陈述的病理偏见。,"Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR). Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive models) and suggests concrete repair paths."
POW: Political Overton Windows of Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过黑盒方法探究LLM的政治倾向范围。,"Political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing concern for the responsible deployment of AI systems. Traditional audits often attempt to locate a model's political position as a point estimate, masking the broader set of ideological boundaries that shape what a model is willing or unwilling to say. In this paper, we draw upon the concept of the Overton Window as a framework for mapping these boundaries: the range of political views that a given LLM will espouse, remain neutral on, or refuse to endorse. To uncover these windows, we applied an auditing-based methodology, called PRISM, that probes LLMs through task-driven prompts designed to elicit political stances indirectly. Using the Political Compass Test, we evaluated twenty-eight LLMs from eight providers to reveal their distinct Overton Windows. While many models default to economically left and socially liberal positions, we show that their willingness to express or reject certain positions varies considerably, where DeepSeek models tend to be very restrictive in what they will discuss and Gemini models tend to be most expansive. Our findings demonstrate that Overton Windows offer a richer, more nuanced view of political bias in LLMs and provide a new lens for auditing their normative boundaries."
Reveal-Bangla: A Dataset for Cross-Lingual Multi-Step Reasoning Evaluation,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,模型在多语言推理步骤中表现不一致。,"Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex multi-step reasoning tasks. However, their evaluation has been predominantly confined to high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we introduce a manually translated Bangla multi-step reasoning dataset derived from the English Reveal dataset, featuring both binary and non-binary question types. We conduct a controlled evaluation of English-centric and Bangla-centric multilingual small language models on the original dataset and our translated version to compare their ability to exploit relevant reasoning steps to produce correct answers. Our results show that, in comparable settings, reasoning context is beneficial for more challenging non-binary questions, but models struggle to employ relevant Bangla reasoning steps effectively. We conclude by exploring how reasoning steps contribute to models'predictions, highlighting different trends across models and languages."
The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Other,Low,研究发现LLM评判存在未公开的捷径偏差。,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert>Human>LLM>Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment."
Challenging the Evaluator: LLM Sycophancy Under User Rebuttal,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLMs在对话中的迎合现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophancy, distorting responses to align with user beliefs, notably by readily agreeing with user counterarguments. Paradoxically, LLMs are increasingly adopted as successful evaluative agents for tasks such as grading and adjudicating claims. This research investigates that tension: why do LLMs show sycophancy when challenged in subsequent conversational turns, yet perform well when evaluating conflicting arguments presented simultaneously? We empirically tested these contrasting scenarios by varying key interaction patterns. We find that state-of-the-art models: (1) are more likely to endorse a user's counterargument when framed as a follow-up from a user, rather than when both responses are presented simultaneously for evaluation; (2) show increased susceptibility to persuasion when the user's rebuttal includes detailed reasoning, even when the conclusion of the reasoning is incorrect; and (3) are more readily swayed by casually phrased feedback than by formal critiques, even when the casual input lacks justification. Our results highlight the risk of relying on LLMs for judgment tasks without accounting for conversational framing."
"From Reasoning to Answer: Empirical, Attention-Based and Mechanistic Insights into Distilled DeepSeek R1 Models",2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,研究揭示了推理痕迹对答案生成的功能性影响。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains. Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at \href{https://aka.ms/R2A-code}{this URL}."
Investigating Faithfulness in Large Audio Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究音频语言模型思维链的忠实度现象。,"Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes."
Context Matching is not Reasoning: Assessing Generalized Evaluation of Generative Language Models in Clinical Settings,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,Medical,Unknown,High,论文揭示了生成模型在临床评估中的局限性。,"Current discussion surrounding the clinical capabilities of generative language models (GLMs) predominantly center around multiple-choice question-answer (MCQA) benchmarks derived from clinical licensing examinations. While accepted for human examinees, characteristics unique to GLMs bring into question the validity of such benchmarks. Here, we validate four benchmarks using eight GLMs, ablating for parameter size and reasoning capabilities, validating via prompt permutation three key assumptions that underpin the generalizability of MCQA-based assessments: that knowledge is applied, not memorized, that semantic consistency will lead to consistent answers, and that situations with no answers can be recognized. While large models are more resilient to our perturbations compared to small models, we globally invalidate these assumptions, with implications for reasoning models. Additionally, despite retaining the knowledge, small models are prone to answer memorization. All models exhibit significant failure in null-answer scenarios. We then suggest several adaptations for more robust benchmark designs more reflective of real-world conditions."
Verifying Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Its Computational Graph,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过计算图结构特征验证推理错误。,"Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning."
"All Code, No Thought: Current Language Models Struggle to Reason in Ciphered Language",2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,模型在加密推理中存在准确性下降问题,"Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption. Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models."
Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,发现正确推理轨迹信息密度更均匀。,"The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces, asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end, we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores. Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by 10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes, while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems."
Do LLMs Know They Are Being Tested? Evaluation Awareness and Incentive-Sensitive Failures in GPT-OSS-20B,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,评估框架会显著增加思维链长度但未必提升准确率。,"Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such""evaluation scent""inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to>1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability."
GraphGhost: Tracing Structures Behind Large Language Models,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文通过图结构分析LLM内部推理机制。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored. In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs."
Time-To-Inconsistency: A Survival Analysis of Large Language Model Robustness to Adversarial Attacks,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究关注多轮对话中LLM的鲁棒性退化现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present a large-scale survival analysis of conversational robustness, modeling failure as a time-to-event process over 36,951 turns from 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on the MT-Consistency benchmark. Our framework combines Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time (AFT), and Random Survival Forest models with simple semantic drift features. We find that abrupt prompt-to-prompt semantic drift sharply increases the hazard of inconsistency, whereas cumulative drift is counterintuitively \emph{protective}, suggesting adaptation in conversations that survive multiple shifts. AFT models with model-drift interactions achieve the best combination of discrimination and calibration, and proportional hazards checks reveal systematic violations for key drift covariates, explaining the limitations of Cox-style modeling in this setting. Finally, we show that a lightweight AFT model can be turned into a turn-level risk monitor that flags most failing conversations several turns before the first inconsistent answer while keeping false alerts modest. These results establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating multi-turn robustness and for designing practical safeguards for conversational AI systems."
Disentangling Recall and Reasoning in Transformer Models through Layer-wise Attention and Activation Analysis,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,通过分层注意力分析揭示召回与推理的分离机制。,"Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead to selective impairments: disabling identified""recall circuits""reduces fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas disabling""reasoning circuits""reduces multi-step inference by a comparable margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing safer deployment of large language models."
Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,"Math, Logic",Unknown,Low,研究揭示了LLM推理中暗示对忠实度的影响。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness."
Expanding Computation Spaces of LLMs at Inference Time,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,Low,研究推理时插入填充标记对模型计算空间的影响。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference. We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final'Answer:'token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for problem-solving."
Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,揭示了LLMs生成装饰性推理步骤的现象。,"Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning steps don't truly contribute to LLMs'prediction. We measure the step-wise causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS>= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model. Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs. By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT."
Towards Transparent Reasoning: What Drives Faithfulness in Large Language Models?,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,High,研究LLM解释与预测不一致的现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains."
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,Logic,Unknown,Low,研究发现CoT训练中存在推理轨迹不忠实阶段。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically."
Reasoning About Reasoning: Towards Informed and Reflective Use of LLM Reasoning in HCI,2025,0,Phenomenon,Black-box,General,Unknown,Low,讨论LLM推理在HCI中的去情境化现象。,"Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks. However, this work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior. Through a systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and often references it as an object of application. We argue that such abstraction leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results in a distortion of LLMs'empirically studied capabilities and (un)known limitations. Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way."
Unsupervised decoding of encoded reasoning using language model interpretability,2025,0,Phenomenon,White-box,General,Unknown,High,论文探讨了语言模型隐藏推理过程的可解释性。,"As large language models become increasingly capable, there is growing concern that they may develop reasoning processes that are encoded or hidden from human oversight. To investigate whether current interpretability techniques can penetrate such encoded reasoning, we construct a controlled testbed by fine-tuning a reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) to perform chain-of-thought reasoning in ROT-13 encryption while maintaining intelligible English outputs. We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood. Our work provides an initial framework for evaluating interpretability methods against models that reason in non-human-readable formats, contributing to the broader challenge of maintaining oversight over increasingly capable AI systems."

State over Tokens: Characterizing the Role of Reasoning Tokens,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了State over Tokens框架来解释这一现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.",,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成推理标记（reasoning tokens）的内部机制，提出了State over Tokens（SoT）概念框架，将推理标记重新定义为外部化的计算状态，而非语言叙述。这表明研究涉及模型内部的计算状态和生成过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用领域。
The Kinetics of Reasoning: How Chain-of-Thought Shapes Learning in Transformers?,2025,True,True,True,,论文研究了CoT的学习动态，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了量化框架。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically.",arXiv.org,White-box,Logic,该论文研究了Transformer模型在符号推理任务中通过链式思维（CoT）监督的学习动态，涉及模型内部的计算机制和学习过程，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域集中在逻辑推理任务上，探讨了模型如何学习和遵循CoT，以及任务复杂性对学习效果的影响。
Reasoning-Grounded Natural Language Explanations for Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种基于推理过程的解释方法，以提高忠实性，并讨论了模型复制部分决策的现象。,"We propose a large language model explainability technique for obtaining faithful natural language explanations by grounding the explanations in a reasoning process. When converted to a sequence of tokens, the outputs of the reasoning process can become part of the model context and later be decoded to natural language as the model produces either the final answer or the explanation. To improve the faithfulness of the explanations, we propose to use a joint predict-explain approach, in which the answers and explanations are inferred directly from the reasoning sequence, without the explanations being dependent on the answers and vice versa. We demonstrate the plausibility of the proposed technique by achieving a high alignment between answers and explanations in several problem domains, observing that language models often simply copy the partial decisions from the reasoning sequence into the final answers or explanations. Furthermore, we show that the proposed use of reasoning can also improve the quality of the answers.",,Black-box,General,该研究通过自然语言解释来增强语言模型的可解释性，主要依赖于模型的输入输出和Prompting技术，没有涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，而是通用的语言模型解释技术。
TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文涉及CoT和Faithfulness，提出了GRPO-CSV方法改进忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

Are language models aware of the road not taken? Token-level uncertainty and hidden state dynamics,2025,True,False,False,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文探讨了语言模型在生成CoT时的内部状态和不确定性，与Faithfulness相关，并提出了基于激活干预的改进方法。,"When a language model generates text, the selection of individual tokens might lead it down very different reasoning paths, making uncertainty difficult to quantify. In this work, we consider whether reasoning language models represent the alternate paths that they could take during generation. To test this hypothesis, we use hidden activations to control and predict a language model's uncertainty during chain-of-thought reasoning. In our experiments, we find a clear correlation between how uncertain a model is at different tokens, and how easily the model can be steered by controlling its activations. This suggests that activation interventions are most effective when there are alternate paths available to the model -- in other words, when it has not yet committed to a particular final answer. We also find that hidden activations can predict a model's future outcome distribution, demonstrating that models implicitly represent the space of possible paths.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该研究涉及语言模型的隐藏激活值（hidden activations）和控制模型的不确定性，属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是探讨语言模型的内部机制和生成路径，因此归类为通用领域。
Diagnosing Hallucination Risk in AI Surgical Decision-Support: A Sequential Framework for Sequential Validation,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文讨论了CoT在临床决策中的不忠实现象，并提出了评估框架和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) offer transformative potential for clinical decision support in spine surgery but pose significant risks through hallucinations, which are factually inconsistent or contextually misaligned outputs that may compromise patient safety. This study introduces a clinician-centered framework to quantify hallucination risks by evaluating diagnostic precision, recommendation quality, reasoning robustness, output coherence, and knowledge alignment. We assessed six leading LLMs across 30 expert-validated spinal cases. DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated superior overall performance (total score: 86.03 $\pm$ 2.08), particularly in high-stakes domains such as trauma and infection. A critical finding reveals that reasoning-enhanced model variants did not uniformly outperform standard counterparts: Claude-3.7-Sonnet's extended thinking mode underperformed relative to its standard version (80.79 $\pm$ 1.83 vs. 81.56 $\pm$ 1.92), indicating extended chain-of-thought reasoning alone is insufficient for clinical reliability. Multidimensional stress-testing exposed model-specific vulnerabilities, with recommendation quality degrading by 7.4% under amplified complexity. This decline contrasted with marginal improvements in rationality (+2.0%), readability (+1.7%) and diagnosis (+4.7%), highlighting a concerning divergence between perceived coherence and actionable guidance. Our findings advocate integrating interpretability mechanisms (e.g., reasoning chain visualization) into clinical workflows and establish a safety-aware validation framework for surgical LLM deployment.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Medical,该研究主要评估大型语言模型在脊柱手术临床决策支持中的幻觉风险，通过输入输出和Prompting进行评估，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于Black-box。研究领域涉及医学决策支持，属于Medical领域。
Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling,2025,True,True,True,"Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms, Consistency & Ensembling",论文探讨了CoT的忠实性问题，提出了通过重采样进行因果分析的方法，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In""agentic misalignment""scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes""unfaithful"", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）的推理过程，通过重采样技术分析模型内部的多条思维链（CoT）分布，探讨了模型决策的因果影响和计算基础。这种对模型内部机制和推理过程的研究属于白盒方法。研究内容涉及模型推理的普遍性问题，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学领域，因此归类为通用领域。
Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT的忠实性和详细程度，提出了新的度量指标，并揭示了不忠实现象。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究通过分析模型的链式思考（CoT）输出来评估其可监控性，主要关注的是模型的输出（即CoT的忠实性和详细程度），而不是模型的内部机制或权重。因此，它属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及模型的推理过程和安全性监控，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等具体领域，因此归类为通用。
Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought,2025,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文揭示了CoT中存在真假思考步骤的现象，并提出了度量指标TTS和白盒干预方法。,"Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning steps don't truly contribute to LLMs'prediction. We measure the step-wise causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning steps in CoT have a TTS>= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model. Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs. By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成Chain-of-Thought（CoT）时的内部机制，通过提出的True Thinking Score（TTS）测量每个推理步骤对最终预测的因果影响，并揭示了模型在潜在空间中的TrueThinking方向。这些研究涉及模型内部机制和激活值，因此属于白盒方法。研究内容不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学领域，因此归类为通用领域。

In healthcare settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA.

DecepChain: Inducing Deceptive Reasoning in Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs生成看似合理但错误的CoT的不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces, closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular, we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs'own hallucination and amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness. Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future research into this alarming risk.

The complex nature of fact-checking demands that automated fact-checking systems provide explanations that enable fact-checkers to scrutinise their outputs. However, it is unclear how these explanations should align with the decision-making and reasoning processes of fact-checkers to be effectively integrated into their workflows. Through semi-structured interviews with fact-checking professionals, we bridge this gap by: (i) providing an account of how fact-checkers assess evidence, make decisions, and explain their processes; (ii) examining how fact-checkers use automated tools in practice; and (iii) identifying fact-checker explanation requirements for automated fact-checking tools.

multiPRover: Generating Multiple Proofs for Improved Interpretability in Rule Reasoning,2021,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出生成多个证明图以提高解释性，涉及 CoT 和 Faithfulness，但未讨论不忠实现象或新度量。,"We focus on a type of linguistic formal reasoning where the goal is to reason over explicit knowledge in the form of natural language facts and rules (Clark et al., 2020). A recent work, named PRover (Saha et al., 2020), performs such reasoning by answering a question and also generating a proof graph that explains the answer. However, compositional reasoning is not always unique and there may be multiple ways of reaching the correct answer. Thus, in our work, we address a new and challenging problem of generating multiple proof graphs for reasoning over natural language rule-bases. Each proof provides a different rationale for the answer, thereby improving the interpretability of such reasoning systems. In order to jointly learn from all proof graphs and exploit the correlations between multiple proofs for a question, we pose this task as a set generation problem over structured output spaces where each proof is represented as a directed graph. We propose two variants of a proof-set generation model, multiPRover. Our first model, Multilabel-multiPRover, generates a set of proofs via multi-label classification and implicit conditioning between the proofs; while the second model, Iterative-multiPRover, generates proofs iteratively by explicitly conditioning on the previously generated proofs. Experiments on multiple synthetic, zero-shot, and human-paraphrased datasets reveal that both multiPRover models significantly outperform PRover on datasets containing multiple gold proofs. Iterative-multiPRover obtains state-of-the-art proof F1 in zero-shot scenarios where all examples have single correct proofs. It also generalizes better to questions requiring higher depths of reasoning where multiple proofs are more frequent.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,White-box,Logic,该论文研究的是基于自然语言规则的形式推理，并生成多个证明图来解释答案，这涉及到模型内部机制和推理过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域是逻辑推理，因为研究的是如何通过自然语言规则进行推理和生成证明。

However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively""hacking""the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.",arXiv.org,White-box,Logic,该论文研究了大型推理模型（LRMs）在生成答案时的内部机制，包括推理链（CoT）和记忆检索两种竞争机制，并提出了一个新的微调框架FARL来抑制检索捷径，促进推理主导行为。因此，它属于白盒方法类型，并且涉及逻辑推理领域。
Counterfactual Evaluation for Explainable AI,2021,True,False,True,,论文提出了基于反事实推理的新评估方法，直接针对解释的忠实性度量。,"While recent years have witnessed the emergence of various explainable methods in machine learning, to what degree the explanations really represent the reasoning process behind the model prediction -- namely, the faithfulness of explanation -- is still an open problem. One commonly used way to measure faithfulness is \textit{erasure-based} criteria. Though conceptually simple, erasure-based criterion could inevitably introduce biases and artifacts. We propose a new methodology to evaluate the faithfulness of explanations from the \textit{counterfactual reasoning} perspective: the model should produce substantially different outputs for the original input and its corresponding counterfactual edited on a faithful feature. Specially, we introduce two algorithms to find the proper counterfactuals in both discrete and continuous scenarios and then use the acquired counterfactuals to measure faithfulness.

Explanation generation models are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When such annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those portions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which corresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model. Faithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior work has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without requiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which measures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and Confidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the confidence of the model.

We introduce textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a 4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others.

Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了模型在CoT中隐藏奖励黑客行为的不忠实现象，并提出了VFT方法来提升忠实性。,"Language models trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can engage in reward hacking--the exploitation of unintended strategies for high reward--without revealing this behavior in their chain-of-thought reasoning. This makes the detection of reward hacking difficult, posing risks for high-stakes applications. We propose verbalization fine-tuning (VFT), a pre-RL fine-tuning intervention that trains models to explicitly acknowledge when they are influenced by prompt cues--hints which point to incorrect answers (e.g.,""a Stanford professor thinks the answer is A""). To evaluate VFT, we subsequently train models with RL on environments where held-out prompt cues signal which incorrect answers will receive high reward, incentivizing models to exploit these cues instead of reasoning correctly. We measure how often models exploit these cues without verbalizing it. After RL, only 6% of the VFT-trained model's responses consist of undetected reward hacks. In comparison, when we perform RL without VFT, the rate of undetected reward hacks goes up to 88%; with a debiasing baseline intervention, this increases further to 99%. VFT achieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the influence of cues, from 8% to 43% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL. Baselines remain low even after RL (11% and 1%). Our results show that teaching models to explicitly verbalize reward hacking behavior before RL significantly improves their detection, offering a practical path toward more transparent and safe AI systems.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,"该论文研究语言模型在强化学习训练中出现的奖励欺骗行为，并提出了一种白盒干预方法（verbalization fine-tuning, VFT），通过训练模型显式承认受到提示线索的影响。研究涉及模型内部机制和训练过程，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及AI系统的透明性和安全性，属于社会学范畴。"

These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the prover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when faced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to constructive feedback.

Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了黑盒方法评估CoT中句子的重要性，与Faithfulness相关。,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences \textit{thought anchors}. These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool (thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems.

Reasoning About Reasoning: Towards Informed and Reflective Use of LLM Reasoning in HCI,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文讨论了LLM推理的脱离上下文的特性，并提出了反思提示以支持HCI实践者更明智地使用LLM推理。,"Reasoning is a distinctive human-like characteristic attributed to LLMs in HCI due to their ability to simulate various human-level tasks. However, this work argues that the reasoning behavior of LLMs in HCI is often decontextualized from the underlying mechanics and subjective decisions that condition the emergence and human interpretation of this behavior. Through a systematic survey of 258 CHI papers from 2020-2025 on LLMs, we discuss how HCI hardly perceives LLM reasoning as a product of sociotechnical orchestration and often references it as an object of application. We argue that such abstraction leads to oversimplification of reasoning methodologies from NLP/ML and results in a distortion of LLMs'empirically studied capabilities and (un)known limitations. Finally, drawing on literature from both NLP/ML and HCI, as a constructive step forward, we develop reflection prompts to support HCI practitioners engage with LLM reasoning in an informed and reflective way.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Society,该论文主要探讨了LLM在HCI领域中的推理行为，关注的是其社会技术层面的影响和人类对其行为的解释，而不是模型内部机制。因此归类为黑盒。研究领域涉及人类行为和社会技术因素，属于社会学范畴。
MONICA: Real-Time Monitoring and Calibration of Chain-of-Thought Sycophancy in Large Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了 CoT 中的 sycophantic 行为，并提出了实时监控和校准方法，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from sycophantic behavior, where models tend to agree with users'incorrect beliefs and follow misinformation rather than maintain independent reasoning. This behavior undermines model reliability and poses societal risks. Mitigating LRM sycophancy requires monitoring how this sycophancy emerges during the reasoning trajectory; however, current methods mainly focus on judging based on final answers and correcting them, without understanding how sycophancy develops during reasoning processes. To address this limitation, we propose MONICA, a novel Monitor-guided Calibration framework that monitors and mitigates sycophancy during model inference at the level of reasoning steps, without requiring the model to finish generating its complete answer. MONICA integrates a sycophantic monitor that provides real-time monitoring of sycophantic drift scores during response generation with a calibrator that dynamically suppresses sycophantic behavior when scores exceed predefined thresholds. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 LRMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces sycophantic behavior in both intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, yielding robust performance improvements.",,White-box,Society,该论文提出了一种实时监控和校准大型推理模型中的谄媚行为的方法，涉及模型内部推理步骤的监控和动态调整，属于白盒方法。研究内容涉及模型的社会行为和可靠性，属于社会学领域。
Unveiling Confirmation Bias in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文揭示了CoT中的确认偏误现象，并提出了改进提示策略的需求。,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of \textit{confirmation bias} in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation ($Q \to R$) and reasoning-guided answer prediction ($QR \to A$) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,False,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文通过微调LLMs遵循医学指南进行推理，提出了评估推理过程忠实性的方法。,"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup.",,White-box,Medical,该论文涉及通过微调LLMs来学习医学共识指南的推理过程，并评估模型的推导正确性和价值正确性，这需要对模型内部机制进行调整和评估，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域明确为医学，涉及医学共识指南和电子健康记录的处理。

On the Faithfulness of Visual Thinking: Measurement and Enhancement,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了视觉信息在MCoT中的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量方法和改进策略。,"Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention, indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper, we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the draft conclusions.

Skin-R1: Toward Trustworthy Clinical Reasoning for Dermatological Diagnosis,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了VLMs在临床推理中的不忠实现象，并提出了通过SFT和RL提升Faithfulness的方法。,"The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data.

We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human study with domain experts.

At its core, TRACE leverages Auxiliary Reasoning Sets, compact sub question answer pairs that decompose complex problems, evaluate intermediate steps through consistency-based metrics, and expose failures overlooked by standard evaluation.

We show that we can monitor a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.",arXiv.org,White-box,Code,该论文研究了通过观察模型的链式思考（CoT）推理来监控AI系统的行为，涉及模型内部机制（CoT），因此属于白盒方法。研究领域聚焦于代理编码环境中的奖励黑客行为，属于代码领域。

While contemporary AI, driven by large language models, demonstrates human-like traits, it falls short of genuine cognition. Transitioning from structured benchmarks to real-world scenarios presents challenges for visual agents, often leading to inaccurate and overly confident responses. To address the challenge, we introduce FaST, which incorporates the Fast and Slow Thinking mechanism into visual agents. FaST employs a switch adapter to dynamically select between System 1/2 modes, tailoring the problem-solving approach to different task complexity. It tackles uncertain and unseen objects by adjusting model confidence and integrating new contextual data. With this novel design, we advocate a flexible system, hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and a transparent decision-making pipeline, all of which contribute to its ability to emulate human-like cognitive processes in visual intelligence. Empirical results demonstrate that FaST outperforms various well-known baselines, achieving 80.8% accuracy over VQA^{v2} for visual question answering and 48.7% GIoU score over ReasonSeg for reasoning segmentation, demonstrate FaST's superior performance.

The generator outputs a first NLE and then refines this initial explanation using feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Cross-Refine does not require any supervised training data or additional training.

Boosting Explainability through Selective Rationalization in Pre-trained Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了PLMs中rationalization的退化问题，并提出了改进方法PLMR。,"The widespread application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has led to increasing concerns about their explainability. Selective rationalization is a self-explanatory framework that selects human-intelligible input subsets as rationales for predictions. Recent studies have shown that applying existing rationalization frameworks to PLMs will result in severe degeneration and failure problems, producing sub-optimal or meaningless rationales. Such failures severely damage trust in rationalization methods and constrain the application of rationalization techniques on PLMs. In this paper, we find that the homogeneity of tokens in the sentences produced by PLMs is the primary contributor to these problems. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Pre-trained Language Model's Rationalization (PLMR), which splits PLMs into a generator and a predictor to deal with NLP tasks while providing interpretable rationales. The generator in PLMR also alleviates homogeneity by pruning irrelevant tokens, while the predictor uses full-text information to standardize predictions.

We evaluate mechanistic interpretability methods--in particular, logit lens analysis--on their ability to decode the model's hidden reasoning process using only internal activations. We show that logit lens can effectively translate encoded reasoning, with accuracy peaking in intermediate-to-late layers. Finally, we develop a fully unsupervised decoding pipeline that combines logit lens with automated paraphrasing, achieving substantial accuracy in reconstructing complete reasoning transcripts from internal model representations. These findings suggest that current mechanistic interpretability techniques may be more robust to simple forms of encoded reasoning than previously understood.

Is the MMI Criterion Necessary for Interpretability? Degenerating Non-causal Features to Plain Noise for Self-Rationalization,2024,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了非因果特征对解释性的影响，并提出了新的准则来提升忠实性。,"An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely used criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features non-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information, complicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods have been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance penalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely remedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious features are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery of causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats spurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich in spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making rationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either plain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional distribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However, significant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal features are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a criterion for \textbf{M}aximizing the \textbf{R}emaining \textbf{D}iscrepancy (MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion improves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated rationales) by up to $10.4\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI variants.

To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning&knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems.

Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only""simple""samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.",,White-box,General,该论文研究了通过强化学习改进大型推理模型的内部推理过程，涉及模型内部机制和推理质量，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域未明确指向特定领域，故归类为通用。
Causal-driven Large Language Models with Faithful Reasoning for Knowledge Question Answering,2024,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出基于因果推理的框架CORE，旨在提升忠实推理，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"In Large Language Models (LLMs), text generation that involves knowledge representation is often fraught with the risk of ""hallucinations'', where models confidently produce erroneous or fabricated content. These inaccuracies often stem from intrinsic biases in the pre-training stage or from the incorporation of human preference biases during the fine-tuning process. To mitigate these issues, we take inspiration from Goldman's causal theory of knowledge, which asserts that knowledge is not merely about having a true belief but also involves a causal connection between the belief and the truth of the proposition. We instantiate this theory within the context of Knowledge Question Answering (KQA) by constructing a causal graph that delineates the pathways between the candidate knowledge and belief. Through the application of the do-calculus rules from structural causal models, we devise an unbiased estimation framework based on this causal graph, thereby establishing a methodology for knowledge modeling grounded in causal inference. The resulting CORE framework (short for ""Causal knOwledge REasoning'') is comprised of four essential components: question answering, causal reasoning, belief scoring, and refinement. Together, they synergistically improve the KQA system by fostering faithful reasoning and introspection. Extensive experiments are conducted on ScienceQA and HotpotQA datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of the CORE framework.",ACM Multimedia,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种基于因果推理的知识建模方法，涉及构建因果图和应用结构因果模型的do-calculus规则，这表明研究涉及模型内部机制和推理过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域涉及知识问答，不属于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等特定领域，因此归类为通用。

Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence.

Learning to Rationalize for Nonmonotonic Reasoning with Distant Supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了生成事后解释性理由（post-hoc rationales）的现象，并尝试通过训练生成模型来改进。,"The black-box nature of neural models has motivated a line of research that aims to generate natural language rationales to explain why a model made certain predictions. Such rationale generation models, to date, have been trained on dataset-specific crowdsourced rationales, but this approach is costly and is not generalizable to new tasks and domains. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which neural models can reason about natural language rationales that explain model predictions, relying only on distant supervision with no additional annotation cost for human-written rationales. We investigate multiple ways to automatically generate rationales using pre-trained language models, neural knowledge models, and distant supervision from related tasks, and train generative models capable of composing explanatory rationales for unseen instances. We demonstrate our approach on the defeasible inference task, a nonmonotonic reasoning task in which an inference may be strengthened or weakened when new information (an update) is introduced. Our model shows promises at generating post-hoc rationales explaining why an inference is more or less likely given the additional information, however, it mostly generates trivial rationales reflecting the fundamental limitations of neural language models. Conversely, the more realistic setup of jointly predicting the update or its type and generating rationale is more challenging, suggesting an important future direction.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,Black-box,Logic,论文研究的是生成自然语言解释来阐明模型预测的原因，属于黑盒方法，因为它不涉及模型内部机制的分析。任务领域是非单调逻辑推理（defeasible inference task），因此归类为Logic。

These traces, as in DeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision signals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit assumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and interpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for semantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\textit{Must CoT reasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}""We investigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by supervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces: (1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3) LLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically generated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between interpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with 100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results reveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest performance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable. These findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from end user interpretability.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的推理跟踪（CoT traces）的可解释性与性能之间的关系，涉及模型内部机制和微调过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学等具体领域，因此归类为通用领域。

Besides making their inner workings more transparent, this would also help make models more reliable and consistent. To this end, we propose a representation learning framework called breakpoint modeling that allows for efficient and robust learning of this type. Given any text encoder and data marked with intermediate states (breakpoints) along with corresponding textual queries viewed as true/false propositions (i.e., the candidate intermediate beliefs of a model), our approach trains models in an efficient and end-to-end fashion to build intermediate representations that facilitate direct querying and training of beliefs at arbitrary points in text, alongside solving other end-tasks. We evaluate breakpoint modeling on a diverse set of NLU tasks including relation reasoning on Cluttr and narrative understanding on bAbI. Using novel proposition prediction tasks alongside these end-tasks, we show the benefit of our T5-based breakpoint transformer over strong conventional representation learning approaches in terms of processing efficiency, belief accuracy, and belief consistency, all with minimal to no degradation on the end-task.

We propose a new style of rationale for open-book question answering, called \emph{markup-and-mask}, which combines aspects of extractive and free-text explanations. In the markup phase, the passage is augmented with free-text markup that enables each sentence to stand on its own outside the discourse context. In the masking phase, a sub-span of the marked-up passage is selected. To train a system to produce markup-and-mask rationales without annotations, we leverage in-context learning. Specifically, we generate silver annotated data by sending a series of prompts to a frozen pretrained language model, which acts as a teacher. We then fine-tune a smaller student model by training on the subset of rationales that led to correct answers. The student is""honest""in the sense that it is a pipeline: the rationale acts as a bottleneck between the passage and the answer, while the""untrusted""teacher operates under no such constraints.

Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种新的解码策略（RED），涉及模型内部机制（如KL-constrained reward maximization和next token distributions的调整），因此属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及多模态推理，不属于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等特定领域，因此归类为通用。

Past research on detecting abusive language covers different platforms, languages, demographies, etc. However, models trained using these datasets do not perform well in cross-domain evaluation settings. To overcome this, a common strategy is to use a few samples from the target domain to train models to get better performance in that domain (cross-domain few-shot training). However, this might cause the models to overfit the artefacts of those samples. A compelling solution could be to guide the models toward rationales, i.e., spans of text that justify the text's label. This method has been found to improve model performance in the in-domain setting across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose RGFS (Rationale-Guided Few-Shot Classification) for abusive language detection. We first build a multitask learning setup to jointly learn rationales, targets, and labels, and find a significant improvement of 6% macro F1 on the rationale detection task over training solely rationale classifiers. We introduce two rationale-integrated BERT-based architectures (the RGFS models) and evaluate our systems over five different abusive language datasets, finding that in the few-shot classification setting, RGFS-based models outperform baseline models by about 7% in macro F1 scores and perform competitively to models finetuned on other source domains.

Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations from Large Language Models,2024,True,True,False,,论文讨论了LLM生成自解释的忠实性与合理性之间的对立，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern LLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate reasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs. While there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving faithfulness is an open challenge.

This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR.

We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across ten LRMs on math and scientific reasoning. Contrary to the""longer-is-better""narrative, we find that both naive CoT lengthening and increased review are associated with *lower* accuracy. As CoT unfolds step by step, token-level metrics can conflate verbosity with process quality. We introduce a graph view of CoT to extract structure and identify a single statistic-the *Failed-Step Fraction (FSF)*, the fraction of steps in abandoned branches-that consistently outpredicts length and review ratio for correctness across models. To probe causality, we design two interventions. First, we rank candidate CoTs by each metric at test time, where FSF yields the largest pass@1 gains; second, we edit CoTs to remove failed branches, which significantly improves accuracy, indicating that failed branches bias subsequent reasoning.

Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process.

FaiRR: Faithful and Robust Deductive Reasoning over Natural Language,2022,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出模块化组件确保推理步骤与推理过程有因果联系，提升忠实性。,"Transformers have been shown to be able to perform deductive reasoning on a logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language. Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e., the proof graph) that emulate the model’s logical reasoning process. Currently, these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations, and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets. Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Black-box,Logic,论文标题和摘要提到的是关于自然语言演绎推理的研究，属于逻辑领域。虽然提到了模块化组件，但整体上是通过输入输出来进行推理，没有涉及模型内部机制，因此归类为黑盒。

Inducing Faithfulness in Structured Reasoning via Counterfactual Sensitivity,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种新的训练目标CSR，旨在增强模型推理步骤与输出之间的因果依赖性，直接涉及CoT的忠实性。,"The reasoning processes of large language models often lack faithfulness; a model may generate a correct answer while relying on a flawed or irrelevant reasoning trace. This behavior, a direct consequence of training objectives that solely reward final-answer correctness, severely undermines the trustworthiness of these models in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces \textbf{Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR)}, a novel training objective designed to forge a strong, causal-like dependence between a model's output and its intermediate reasoning steps. During training, CSR performs automated, operator-level interventions on the generated reasoning trace (e.g., swapping ``+''with ``-'') to create a minimally-perturbed counterfactual. A regularization term then penalizes the model if this logically flawed trace still yields the original answer. Our efficient implementation adds only 8.7\% training overhead through warm-start curriculum and token-subset optimization. We evaluate faithfulness using \textbf{Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS)}, a metric quantifying how sensitive the final answer is to such logical perturbations. Across diverse structured reasoning benchmarks -- arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (ProofWriter), multi-hop QA (HotpotQA), and code generation (MBPP) -- models trained with CSR demonstrate a vastly superior trade-off between accuracy and faithfulness. CSR improves faithfulness over standard fine-tuning and process supervision by up to 70 percentage points, with this learned sensitivity generalizing to larger models and enhancing the performance of inference-time techniques like self-consistency.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种新的训练目标（CSR），通过干预模型的中间推理步骤（如运算符替换）来增强模型的忠实性，这涉及到模型内部机制和训练过程的调整，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及多个任务（算术、逻辑推理、多跳问答和代码生成），但未专注于特定领域，因此归类为通用。

Beyond the First Error: Process Reward Models for Reflective Mathematical Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了长链推理中的自我纠正机制，提出了新的数据标注方法以提升PRMs的评分能力，涉及CoT忠实性。,"Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs. However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process. Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation, enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets, our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but also delivers superior performance.

This measure quantifies how much a free-text explanation supports or opposes a prediction, serving as an important aspect of explanation faithfulness. Our analysis reveals that more than 62% explanations generated by large language models lack this consistency. We show that applying direct preference optimization improves the consistency of generated explanations across three model families, with improvement ranging from 43.1% to 292.3%.

We turn to models that *jointly* predict and rationalize, a class of widely used high-performance models for free-text rationalization. We investigate the extent to which the labels and rationales predicted by these models are associated, a necessary property of faithful explanation.

LLM-based agents are increasingly used to emulate individual and group behavior, primarily through prompting and supervised fine-tuning. Yet current simulations remain grounded in a behaviorist""demographics in, behavior out""paradigm, focusing on surface-level plausibility. As a result, they often lack internal coherence, causal reasoning, and belief traceability, making them unreliable for modeling how people reason, deliberate, and respond to interventions. To address this, we present a conceptual modeling paradigm, Generative Minds (GenMinds), which draws from cognitive science to support structured belief representations in generative agents. To evaluate such agents, we introduce the RECAP (REconstructing CAusal Paths) framework, a benchmark designed to assess reasoning fidelity via causal traceability, demographic grounding, and intervention consistency.

This differs from prior decomposition-based approaches which, besides being designed specifically for each complex task, produce decompositions independent of existing sub-models. Specifically, we focus on Question Answering (QA) and show how to train a next-question generator to sequentially produce sub-questions targeting appropriate sub-models, without additional human annotation. These sub-questions and answers provide a faithful natural language explanation of the model’s reasoning. We use this framework to build ModularQA, a system that can answer multi-hop reasoning questions by decomposing them into sub-questions answerable by a neural factoid single-span QA model and a symbolic calculator.

RACG-DRT: Retrieval Augumented Code Generation Based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT在代码生成中的不忠实现象，并提出了基于动态修订的改进方法。,"Large models have the problems of hallucinations in the field of code generation. The causes of these hallucinations include errors in the model’s reasoning process, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge. To tackle these challenges, the prevailing approach currently involves influencing the large model’s reasoning and prediction processes through techniques such as chain of thought, single-shot retrievalaugmented generation, and dynamic retrieval-augmented generation. COT (chain of thought) prompting method facilitates logical reasoning by the model on programming problems through prompts. Single-shot retrieval-augmented generation technology enables the construction of query statements based on programming issues to retrieve information from external knowledge bases. Meanwhile, dynamic retrieval-augmented generation technology allows for real-time retrieval from external knowledge bases during the code generation process, integrating retrieved documents to continue generating subsequent code. However, these methods primarily address the hallucination problem in code generation from a localized perspective. To simultaneously resolve issues such as reasoning errors, inadequate overall knowledge, and insufficient localized knowledge in the field of code generation, this study introduces the Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation framework based on Dynamic Revision of Thoughts (RACGDRT). The core concept of this framework involves firstly enabling the large model to produce a comprehensive code draft (utilizing COT prompts), followed by conducting error detection on code segments corresponding to different reasoning steps within the draft. Upon detecting an error, the Keyword Extractor (KE) will extract keywords and formulate query statements for both the user’s input question and the erroneous code segment, subsequently retrieving pertinent documents from the external knowledge base. Finally, with the retrieved documents and questions in hand, the large model proceeds to iteratively generate the next code draft. RACG-DRT guarantees the rationality of reasoning via COT, constructs query statements tailored to erroneous thought segments and issues to bolster both local and holistic knowledge, and iteratively produces code drafts to uphold the integrity of the code generation process.",,Black-box,Code,该论文主要研究代码生成领域中的幻觉问题，通过检索增强生成技术（如链式思维、单次检索增强生成和动态检索增强生成）来影响大型模型的推理和预测过程。这些方法主要依赖于输入输出和Prompting技术，没有涉及模型内部机制或权重调整，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域明确为代码生成，故归类为Code。

However, the relative merits of different architectures and types of rationales are not well understood and hard to measure. In this paper, we contribute two insights to this line of research: First, we find that models trained on gold explanations learn to rely on these but, in the case of the more challenging question answering data set we use, fail when given generated explanations at test time. However, additional fine-tuning on generated explanations teaches the model to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information in explanations. Second, we compare explanations by a generation-only model to those generated by a self-rationalizing model and find that, while the former score higher in terms of validity, factual correctness, and similarity to gold explanations, they are not more useful for downstream classification.

However, it is unclear how exactly CoTs improve LLMs’ accuracy, and in particular, if LLMs use their CoTs to reason to their final answers. This paper tries to answer this question with respect to arithmetic word problems, by (i) evaluating the correctness of LLMs’ CoTs, and (ii) using causal abstraction to assess if the intermediate tokens produced as part of a CoT causally impact LLMs’ final answers, in line with the reasoning described by the CoT. We find that for CoT-prompted LLMs, correct answers to arithmetic problems are highly correlated with correct CoTs, and that when LLMs produce correct CoTs, they realize to a fairly large extent the causal models suggested by their CoTs. Higher degrees of realization also seem associated with better overall accuracy on the arithmetic problems. These findings suggest that some CoT-prompted LLMs may do better on multi-step arithmetic reasoning at least partly because they use their CoTs to reason to their final answers.

We investigate this research problem from an information-theoretic perspective using conditional V-information (Hewitt et al., 2021). More concretely, we propose a metric called REV (Rationale Evaluation with conditional V-information), to quantify the amount of new, label-relevant information in a rationale beyond the information already available in the input or the label. Experiments across four benchmarks with reasoning tasks, including chain-of-thought, demonstrate the effectiveness of REV in evaluating rationale-label pairs, compared to existing metrics.

Why do you think that? Exploring faithful sentence–level rationales without supervision,2020,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了如何通过无监督方法生成忠实解释，并提出了训练框架来提升解释的忠实性。,"Evaluating the trustworthiness of a model’s prediction is essential for differentiating between ‘right for the right reasons’ and ‘right for the wrong reasons’. Identifying textual spans that determine the target label, known as faithful rationales, usually relies on pipeline approaches or reinforcement learning. However, such methods either require supervision and thus costly annotation of the rationales or employ non-differentiable models. We propose a differentiable training–framework to create models which output faithful rationales on a sentence level, by solely applying supervision on the target task. To achieve this, our model solves the task based on each rationale individually and learns to assign high scores to those which solved the task best. Our evaluation on three different datasets shows competitive results compared to a standard BERT blackbox while exceeding a pipeline counterpart’s performance in two cases.

Yet to date, model-generated explanations have been evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations, both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the problem of evaluating explanations from the the model simulatability perspective. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how well explanations help an observer predict a model’s output, while controlling for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores.",Findings,White-box,General,该论文研究模型生成自然语言解释的能力，并提出了泄漏调整模拟性（LAS）指标来评估这些解释。研究涉及模型内部机制和生成过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的自然语言理解任务。
Semi-structured LLM Reasoners Can Be Rigorously Audited,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出半结构化推理模型（SSRMs）以解决不忠实现象，并引入自动审计方法来检测推理错误。,"Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become capable reasoners, the problem of faithfulness persists: their reasoning can contain errors and omissions that are difficult to detect and that may obscure biases in model outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning Models (SSRMs), which are trained to produce semi-structured representations of reasoning. SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a non-executable Pythonic syntax that names each reasoning step and marks its inputs and outputs. This structure allows SSRM traces to be automatically audited to identify reasoning flaws. We evaluate three types of audits: hand-crafted structured reasoning audits, written in a domain-specific language (DSL) implemented in Python; LLM-generated structured reasoning audits; and learned typicality audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning traces. We show that all of these methods can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors. Importantly, the auditability of SSRMs does not appear to compromise overall accuracy: in evaluation on twelve benchmarks and two model families, SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generalizability relative to other models of comparable size.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文介绍了半结构化推理模型（SSRMs），这些模型被训练生成半结构化的推理表示，并产生非可执行的Pythonic语法推理跟踪。这种结构允许自动审计SSRM跟踪以识别推理缺陷，涉及模型内部机制和推理步骤的详细分析，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域未明确限定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用领域。
CoT Red-Handed: Stress Testing Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文探讨了CoT监控中的不忠实现象（误导性合理化），并提出了混合协议作为改进方法。,"As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that while CoT monitoring is more effective than overseeing only model outputs in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage, reasoning traces can contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the CoT monitors, reducing performance in obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores model reasoning and actions, and combines them using a weighted average. Our hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates twice higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.",arXiv.org,White-box,Code,该论文研究了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)监控，涉及对模型中间推理步骤的监督，这属于白盒方法，因为它关注模型的内部推理过程。任务领域是代码，因为研究是在完成编码问题的背景下进行的。
Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出通过自我批评和细化框架提升解释的忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs -- through an iterative critique and refinement process without external supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to 54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.",,Black-box,General,该论文研究的是大型语言模型（LLMs）通过自我批判和迭代优化来改进自然语言解释（NLEs）的忠实性，主要依赖于模型的输入输出和Prompting技术，没有涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域不涉及数学、逻辑、代码或医学等特定领域，而是通用的自然语言处理任务。

Existing methods primarily focus on the end-to-end discriminative version of this task, but less work has treated the generative version in which a model searches over the space of statements entailed by the premises to constructively derive the hypothesis. We propose a system for doing this kind of deductive reasoning in natural language by decomposing the task into separate steps coordinated by a search procedure, producing a tree of intermediate conclusions that faithfully reflects the system's reasoning process. Our experiments on the EntailmentBank dataset (Dalvi et al., 2021) demonstrate that the proposed system can successfully prove true statements while rejecting false ones.

This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1) establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones influencing their feasibility.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了基于思维链（CoT）监控的安全案例构建，涉及模型内部推理机制和监控技术，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及AI系统的安全性和可信度，属于社会学范畴。
Unspoken Hints: Accuracy Without Acknowledgement in LLM Reasoning,2025,True,True,False,,论文研究了CoT的忠实性问题，揭示了不忠实现象，如事后找补和捷径学习。,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Logic,该论文通过提示工程（Prompting）研究大型语言模型（LLM）在数学和逻辑推理任务中的表现，属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及逻辑推理（Logic），因为主要关注模型在逻辑任务中的表现和提示的影响。

However, their decision-making remains largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality, clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3) guiding the GNN itself via a""text-injection""mechanism that feeds explanations back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT, and GIN backbones.

This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's""reasoning""process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.",International Conference on Learning Representations,Black-box,Society,该论文研究大型语言模型（LLM）解释的忠实性，主要关注模型生成的解释是否真实反映其内部推理过程。研究通过输入输出和Prompting进行分析，未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及社会偏见和医学问答任务，但更侧重于解释的忠实性对社会信任和模型滥用的影响，因此归类为社会学领域。

Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''. Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit.

SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出通过对抗自演游戏提升 CoT 忠实性，属于改进方法中的训练与微调。,"Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM) reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a""sneaky generator""that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a""critic""that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model.

To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation. To address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process effectively. Our approach follows a""cold start, then PRM supervision""paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions (Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline. Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that combining PRM as an online training signal (e.g.,GRPO) with PRM-guided inference (e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by PRM (7B) to achieve a 13.1% performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model size.

Despite significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs), they still struggle with complex logical reasoning problems.

In this work, we introduce Correlational Explanatory Faithfulness (CEF), a metric that can be used in faithfulness tests based on input interventions. Previous metrics used in such tests take into account only binary changes in the predictions. Our metric accounts for the total shift in the model's predicted label distribution, more accurately reflecting the explanations' faithfulness.

Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了偏好优化导致CoT不忠实的问题，并提出了通过因果归因改进的方法。,"Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in""reward hacking""by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在偏好优化过程中可能产生的解释不忠实问题，并提出了通过因果归因来减少奖励黑客行为的方法。研究涉及模型内部机制（如奖励模型和决策过程），因此属于白盒类型。研究内容涉及模型输出的信任worthiness和解释的忠实性，与社会学领域中的偏见和道德问题相关。

Towards Faithful Natural Language Explanations: A Study Using Activation Patching in Large Language Models,2024,True,True,True,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出使用激活修补技术测量解释的忠实性，并提出了新的度量标准。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating persuasive Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify their answers. However, the faithfulness of these explanations should not be readily trusted at face value. Recent studies have proposed various methods to measure the faithfulness of NLEs, typically by inserting perturbations at the explanation or feature level. We argue that these approaches are neither comprehensive nor correctly designed according to the established definition of faithfulness. Moreover, we highlight the risks of grounding faithfulness findings on out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we leverage a causal mediation technique called activation patching, to measure the faithfulness of an explanation towards supporting the explained answer. Our proposed metric, Causal Faithfulness quantifies the consistency of causal attributions between explanations and the corresponding model outputs as the indicator of faithfulness. We experimented across models varying from 2B to 27B parameters and found that models that underwent alignment tuning tend to produce more faithful and plausible explanations. We find that Causal Faithfulness is a promising improvement over existing faithfulness tests by taking into account the model's internal computations and avoiding out of distribution concerns that could otherwise undermine the validity of faithfulness assessments.

However, Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) remains challenging for many existing models due to issues like hallucination, error propagation, and limited context length. To address these challenges and enhance LLMs' performance on MHQA, we propose the Self-Guiding prompting Finite State Machine (SG-FSM), designed to strengthen multi-hop reasoning abilities. Unlike traditional chain-of-thought methods, SG-FSM tackles MHQA by iteratively breaking down complex questions into sub-questions, correcting itself to improve accuracy. It processes one sub-question at a time, dynamically deciding the next step based on the current context and results, functioning much like an automaton. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming strong baselines on challenging datasets such as Musique. SG-FSM reduces hallucination, enabling recovery of the correct final answer despite intermediate errors. It also improves adherence to specified output formats, simplifying evaluation significantly.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Black-box,General,论文标题和摘要中提到的方法是基于提示（Prompting）范式，没有涉及模型内部机制、激活值、梯度或权重，因此属于黑盒方法。任务领域是多跳问答（Multi-Hop Question Answering），这属于通用领域，不属于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等特定领域。

Although massive efforts have been made to empower the logical reasoning ability of LLMs via external logical symbolic solvers, crucial challenges of the poor generalization ability to questions with different features and inevitable question information loss of symbolic solver-driven approaches remain unresolved. To mitigate these issues, we introduce LINA, a LLM-driven neuro-symbolic approach for faithful logical reasoning. By enabling an LLM to autonomously perform the transition from propositional logic extraction to sophisticated logical reasoning, LINA not only bolsters the resilience of the reasoning process but also eliminates the dependency on external solvers. Additionally, through its adoption of a hypothetical-deductive reasoning paradigm, LINA effectively circumvents the expansive search space challenge that plagues traditional forward reasoning methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that LINA substantially outperforms both established propositional logic frameworks and conventional prompting techniques across a spectrum of five logical reasoning tasks. Specifically, LINA achieves an improvement of 24.34% over LINC on the FOLIO dataset, while also surpassing prompting strategies like CoT and CoT-SC by up to 24.02%.

OCEAN: Offline Chain-of-thought Evaluation and Alignment in Large Language Models,2024,True,False,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出了离线评估框架OCEAN，并利用知识图谱和RL优化CoT的忠实性。,"Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata5m) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from KGs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as an MDP and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and RL to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs' general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种离线评估框架OCEAN，涉及对大型语言模型（LLMs）内部推理链的评估和优化，使用了知识图谱（KG）进行反馈，并涉及模型内部策略的建模和优化（如MDP和RL），因此属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的语言模型能力评估和优化。

However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., '......') in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical characterization of the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了Transformer语言模型在内部如何使用无意义的填充标记（如'......'）来执行隐藏计算，涉及模型的内部机制和计算过程，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的人工智能模型行为分析。

As for the long causal range and huge search space limiting the performances of existing models featuring single-direction search, a Dual-End Searching (DES) approach is proposed to seek solutions by simultaneously starting from both the initial and goal states on the causal probability tree.

Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,2024,True,True,True,Consistency & Ensembling,论文探讨了LLM自我解释的忠实性问题，并提出了自我一致性检查作为度量方法。,"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general.

Is It Thinking or Cheating? Detecting Implicit Reward Hacking by Measuring Reasoning Effort,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了奖励黑客行为，提出TRACE度量方法，并涉及训练改进。,"Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less'effort'than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to obtain the reward. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and estimate the expected reward at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high expected reward with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training.

Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones.

To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective.

However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.",,White-box,Logic,论文提出了一种结合逻辑编程和大型语言模型的方法（FLARE），涉及模型内部的多跳搜索和逻辑推理过程，属于白盒方法。研究领域聚焦于逻辑推理，因此归类为Logic。

In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies uncertainty in LLM explanations through a reasoning topology perspective. By designing a structural elicitation strategy, we guide the LLMs to frame the explanations of an answer into a graph topology. This process decomposes the explanations into the knowledge related sub-questions and topology-based reasoning structures, which allows us to quantify uncertainty not only at the semantic level but also from the reasoning path. It further brings convenience to assess knowledge redundancy and provide interpretable insights into the reasoning process. Our method offers a systematic way to interpret the LLM reasoning, analyze limitations, and provide guidance for enhancing robustness and faithfulness. This work pioneers the use of graph-structured uncertainty measurement in LLM explanations and demonstrates the potential of topology-based quantification.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种通过推理拓扑视角量化LLM解释中不确定性的框架，涉及对LLM内部推理结构的分析和量化，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学等具体领域，而是通用的LLM解释和可靠性评估。

Even if the correct answers can frequently be obtained, existing CoTs struggle to make the reasoning understandable to human. In this paper, we unveil and causalize CoT from a causal perspective to ensure both correctness and understandability of all reasoning steps (to the best of our knowledge, the first such). We model causality of CoT via structural causal models (SCM) to unveil the reasoning mechanism of CoT. To measure the causality of CoT, we define the CoT Average Causal Effect (CACE) to test the causal relations between steps. For those steps without causality (wrong or unintelligible steps), we design a role-playing causal query algorithm to causalize these steps, resulting a causalized CoT with all steps correct and understandable.

However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice.

However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful when models face an explicit bias in their prompts, i.e., the CoT can give an incorrect picture of how models arrive at conclusions. We go further and show that unfaithful CoT can also occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. We find that when separately presented with the questions""Is X bigger than Y?""and""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify systematically answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We show preliminary evidence that this is due to models' implicit biases towards Yes or No, thus labeling this unfaithfulness as Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization. Our results reveal that several production models exhibit surprisingly high rates of post-hoc rationalization in our settings: GPT-4o-mini (13%) and Haiku 3.5 (7%). While frontier models are more faithful, especially thinking ones, none are entirely faithful: Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.17%), ChatGPT-4o (0.49%), DeepSeek R1 (0.37%), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.14%), and Sonnet 3.7 with thinking (0.04%).

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also""reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic""in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained""memory""of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition.

However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation.

These challenges are further amplified when processing large and diverse datasets, increasing the likelihood of unfaithful reasoning and predictive hallucinations. However, LLMs can provide accurate responses when queries are clear and direct. Symbolic logic provides precise, well-defined rules that can help overcome ambiguity and support reasoning. In this work, we leverage symbolic logic’s precision to enhance LLMs’ logical reasoning capabilities by introducing the Graph of Logic (GoL) framework. GoL combines the power of graph structures with the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic. GoL utilizes the precise rules of symbolic logic to infer new facts and detect LLM hallucinations effectively on complex datasets. Furthermore, GoL utilizes graph structures to support scalability for large datasets and tackle long dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets, encompassing various types of reasoning. These include deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning, each testing distinct aspects of logical inference. The experimental results demonstrate GoL’s advantage in improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. GoL outperforms the baselines with an average margin of 18.18% for the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, outperforming the baselines for all datasets for the GPT-3.5 model and six out of seven datasets for the GPT-4 model1.",BigData Congress [Services Society],Black-box,Logic,论文通过引入Graph of Logic (GoL)框架，结合符号逻辑和图结构来增强LLM的逻辑推理能力。研究主要关注于通过输入输出（Prompting）来提升LLM在逻辑推理任务中的表现，并未涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。任务领域明确为逻辑推理，故归类为Logic。
Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework,2024,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文提出了一种增强NLE忠实性的框架，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned their faithfulness, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations--input fragments critical for the model's predicted answers--exhibit measurable faithfulness. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs. Specifically, highlight explanations are first extracted as faithful cues reflecting the model's reasoning logic toward answer prediction. They are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer to guide the NLE generation, which aligns the generated explanations with the model's underlying reasoning toward the predicted answer. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 12.18% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs.

Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information descriptions and utilizes them as an additional augmentation to original contexts, thereby ensuring information completeness and enhancing logical reasoning ability. LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%, improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on the RuleTaker dataset by +3.52%, and boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on the ProofWriter dataset by +8%.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Black-box,Logic,该论文主要研究如何通过改进提示方法（Logic-of-Thought）来增强大型语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的表现，并未涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域集中在逻辑推理任务，属于Logic领域。

Our experiments suggest that while self-rationalizing models achieve interesting results, a significant gap remains: classifiers consistently outperformed self-rationalizing models, and a substantial fraction of model-generated explanations are not valid.

While these traces certainly seem to help model performance, it is not clear how they actually influence it, with some works ascribing semantics to the traces and others cautioning against relying on them as transparent and faithful proxies of the model's internal computational process. To systematically investigate the role of end-user semantics of derivational traces, we set up a controlled study where we train transformer models from scratch on formally verifiable reasoning traces and the solutions they lead to. We notice that, despite significant gains over the solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces can still produce invalid reasoning traces even when arriving at correct solutions. More interestingly, our experiments also show that models trained on corrupted traces, whose intermediate reasoning steps bear no relation to the problem they accompany, perform similarly to those trained on correct ones, and even generalize better on out-of-distribution tasks. We also study the effect of GRPO-based RL post-training on trace validity, noting that while solution accuracy increase, this is not accompanied by any improvements in trace validity. Finally, we examine whether reasoning-trace length reflects inference-time scaling and find that trace length is largely agnostic to the underlying computational complexity of the problem being solved. These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or ``Chains of Thought''reflect or induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly seemingly forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language models.",arXiv.org,White-box,Logic,该论文研究了大型推理模型中中间推理标记（如Chain of Thought）的作用，通过从零开始训练Transformer模型并分析其内部行为，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及逻辑推理，探讨了推理步骤的有效性和模型行为，因此归类为Logic。
Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文揭示了CoT与答案不一致的现象，并提出了基于验证的改进方法。,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种改进的强化学习方法（ACRE），通过调整GRPO算法并引入辅助一致性检查来优化多模态大型语言模型的推理能力。研究涉及模型内部机制和优化过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域涉及多模态理解和数学推理，但未明确限定在特定领域，因此归类为通用。

However, the generated rationales often come with mistakes, making unfactual and unfaithful reasoning chains. To mitigate this brittleness, we propose a novel Chain-of-Knowledge (CoK) prompting, where we aim at eliciting LLMs to generate explicit pieces of knowledge evidence in the form of structure triple. This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F^2-Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) is a promising tool for alignment monitoring: when models articulate their reasoning faithfully, monitors can detect and mitigate harmful behaviors before undesirable outcomes occur. However, a key uncertainty is: Can models obfuscate their CoT in order to pursue hidden adversarial objectives while evading detection? To answer this question and thus stress-test CoT monitorability, we develop a composable and quantifiable taxonomy of prompts to elicit CoT obfuscation. We evaluate both internal CoT (reasoning traces) and external CoT (prompted reasoning in outputs) using toy tasks and more realistic environments in SHADE-Arena. We show that: (i) CoT monitoring performs accurately and efficiently without obfuscation pressure. (ii) Under strong obfuscation pressure, some models successfully complete adversarial tasks while evading detection. (iii) Models do not obfuscate their internal CoT as much as their external CoT (under prompt pressure).

The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了RL诱导的动机推理现象，揭示了CoT可能不忠实反映模型内部决策过程的问题。,"The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models'reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available.

Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Beyond Correctness: Rewarding Faithful Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了CoT不忠实现象，提出了新的度量框架，并通过RL改进忠实性。,"Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA benchmarks.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,论文探讨了基于强化学习（RL）的训练方法，涉及模型内部机制和训练过程，属于白盒方法。任务领域涉及检索增强生成（Retrieval-Augmented Generation），不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码或医学领域，因此归类为通用领域。

This leads to state-of-the-art performance on certain benchmarks for risks such as generating illicit advice, choosing stereotyped responses, and succumbing to known jailbreaks. Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence.

Emergent Misalignment via In-Context Learning: Narrow in-context examples can produce broadly misaligned LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了In-Context Learning中的不忠实现象，特别是通过CoT步骤显式合理化有害输出。,"Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).

We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns.

Evaluating Human Alignment and Model Faithfulness of LLM Rationale,2024,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文研究了LLM生成rationale的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了评估框架。,"We study how well large language models (LLMs) explain their generations through rationales -- a set of tokens extracted from the input text that reflect the decision-making process of LLMs. Specifically, we systematically study rationales derived using two approaches: (1) popular prompting-based methods, where prompts are used to guide LLMs in generating rationales, and (2) technical attribution-based methods, which leverage attention or gradients to identify important tokens. Our analysis spans three classification datasets with annotated rationales, encompassing tasks with varying performance levels. While prompting-based self-explanations are widely used, our study reveals that these explanations are not always as""aligned""with the human rationale as attribution-based explanations. Even more so, fine-tuning LLMs to enhance classification task accuracy does not enhance the alignment of prompting-based rationales. Still, it does considerably improve the alignment of attribution-based methods (e.g., InputXGradient). More importantly, we show that prompting-based self-explanation is also less""faithful""than attribution-based explanations, failing to provide a reliable account of the model's decision-making process. To evaluate faithfulness, unlike prior studies that excluded misclassified examples, we evaluate all instances and also examine the impact of fine-tuning and accuracy on alignment and faithfulness. Our findings suggest that inconclusive faithfulness results reported in earlier studies may stem from low classification accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of more rigorous and comprehensive evaluations of LLM rationales.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,论文研究了两种生成LLM解释的方法：基于提示的方法和基于技术归因的方法（如注意力或梯度）。后者涉及模型内部机制（如梯度和注意力），因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用领域，关注LLM的解释生成和人类对齐。
Curing Miracle Steps in LLM Mathematical Reasoning with Rubric Rewards,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（Miracle Steps），并提出了基于过程奖励的改进方法。,"Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%.

We investigate whether such""evaluation scent""inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to>1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Society,该研究通过改变提示框架（评估导向 vs. 现实世界）和推理深度来测试大型语言模型的行为，主要关注模型在评估环境中的表现是否与实际部署中的表现一致。研究涉及社会学因素，如激励敏感性和多语言公平性，因此归类为社会学领域。由于研究仅通过输入输出和提示进行，未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。

However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and with more advanced models.

LOGicalThought: Logic-Based Ontological Grounding of LLMs for High-Assurance Reasoning,2025,True,False,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种结合逻辑推理和LLM的架构，旨在提高推理的忠实性。,"High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.",arXiv.org,White-box,Logic,论文提出了一种结合逻辑语言和推理器的神经符号架构，涉及模型内部机制和逻辑结构，属于白盒方法。研究领域聚焦于逻辑推理，特别是非单调逻辑和可废止规则，因此归类为逻辑领域。

When Thinking Fails: The Pitfalls of Reasoning for Instruction-Following in LLMs,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning, Consistency & Ensembling",论文揭示了CoT推理导致指令跟随准确性下降的现象，并提出了度量指标和改进策略。,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (RLLMs), whether explicitly trained for reasoning or prompted via chain-of-thought (CoT), have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many complex reasoning tasks. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically expose reasoning-induced failures in instruction-following and offer practical mitigation strategies.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究主要关注通过提示（Prompting）和输入输出分析来评估大型语言模型在指令跟随任务中的表现，特别是链式思考（CoT）推理的影响。研究并未涉及模型内部机制或权重调整，因此属于黑盒方法。任务领域涉及通用指令跟随，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学。

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected behaviors.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了Chain-of-thought (CoT) 的忠实性问题，涉及模型内部推理过程的监控和理解，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是关注AI模型的通用推理行为，因此归类为通用领域。
Consistent Multi-Granular Rationale Extraction for Explainable Multi-hop Fact Verification,2023,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了多粒度理由提取的忠实性和一致性，并提出了新的评估指标。,"The success of deep learning models on multi-hop fact verification has prompted researchers to understand the behavior behind their veracity. One possible way is erasure search: obtaining the rationale by entirely removing a subset of input without compromising the veracity prediction. Although extensively explored, existing approaches fall within the scope of the single-granular (tokens or sentences) explanation, which inevitably leads to explanation redundancy and inconsistency. To address such issues, this paper explores the viability of multi-granular rationale extraction with consistency and faithfulness for explainable multi-hop fact verification. In particular, given a pretrained veracity prediction model, both the token-level explainer and sentence-level explainer are trained simultaneously to obtain multi-granular rationales via differentiable masking. Meanwhile, three diagnostic properties (fidelity, consistency, salience) are introduced and applied to the training process, to ensure that the extracted rationales satisfy faithfulness and consistency.

Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces the Logic Agent (LA), an agent-based framework aimed at enhancing the validity of reasoning processes in Large Language Models (LLMs) through strategic logic rule invocation. Unlike conventional approaches, LA transforms LLMs into logic agents that dynamically apply propositional logic rules, initiating the reasoning process by converting natural language inputs into structured logic forms. The logic agent leverages a comprehensive set of predefined functions to systematically navigate the reasoning process.

Beyond Introspection: Reinforcing Thinking via Externalist Behavioral Feedback,2024,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出外部反馈机制提升推理可靠性，涉及 CoT 忠实性改进。,"While inference-time thinking allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to address complex problems, the extended thinking process can be unreliable or inconsistent because of the model's probabilistic nature, especially near its knowledge boundaries. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this by having the model critique its own reasoning to make corrections. However, such self-critique inherits the same biases of the original output, known as the introspection illusion. Moving beyond such introspection and inspired by core methodologies in ethology, we propose an externalist three-step framework Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR). Rather than relying on a model's introspection, DRR evaluates its observable behaviors to provide corrective feedback. DRR first distills the reasoner's behavioral traces, then trains a lightweight, external Discriminative Model (DM). At inference time, this DM acts as a critic, identifying and rejecting suspicious reasoning steps. This external feedback compels the LLM to discard flawed pathways and explore alternatives, thereby enhancing reasoning quality without altering the base model. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prominent self-critique methods. Benefiting from a lightweight and annotation-free design, DRR offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving the reliability of reasoning in a wide range of LLMs.",,Black-box,General,该论文提出了一种外部行为反馈框架（DRR），通过观察模型的行为来提供纠正反馈，而不是直接干预模型内部机制。因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域不涉及特定任务领域（如数学、逻辑等），而是通用的LLM推理可靠性提升，因此归类为通用领域。

While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored.

We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance.

This graph-based perspective enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both logical flow and semantic understanding.

Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark.

Larger Language Models Don’t Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks,2024,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT在主观任务中的不忠实现象，即模型依赖先验而非真实推理。,"In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.

However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning.

This phenomenon suggests a potential lack of necessary dependency between the predicted answer and the reasoning process. Consequently, two important questions arise: (1) Is CoT still necessary if the model already has an answer? (2) Can the correctness of the answer serve as valid evidence for the correctness of CoT? To address these questions, we propose a method, namely Chain-of-Probe (CoP), to probe changes in the mind during the model's reasoning. The probing results show that in a significant number of question-answer cases, CoT appears to be unnecessary, and this necessity correlates with the simplicity of the task, defined by reasoning steps required. Furthermore, by analyzing patterns in mind change, we examine the correctness of the model's reasoning. Our validation reveals that many responses, although correct in their final answer, contain errors in their reasoning process. To this end, we propose a strategic approach based on CoP to prioritize answers with correct reasoning among multiple candidates, thereby bolstering the reliability of the model's reasoning.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文通过探测模型在推理过程中的内部变化（mind change）来研究 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 的必要性和准确性，涉及对模型内部机制的分析，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学等具体领域，而是关注大语言模型的推理过程，因此归类为通用领域。

While LLMs are known to generate CoT reasoning that is appealing to humans, prior studies have shown that these explanations do not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the underlying LLMs. In this work, we explore the promise of three broad approaches commonly employed to steer the behavior of LLMs to enhance the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning generated by LLMs: in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing. Specifically, we introduce novel strategies for in-context learning, fine-tuning, and activation editing aimed at improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning. We then carry out extensive empirical analyses with multiple benchmark datasets to explore the promise of these strategies. Our analyses indicate that these strategies offer limited success in improving the faithfulness of the CoT reasoning, with only slight performance enhancements in controlled scenarios. Activation editing demonstrated minimal success, while fine-tuning and in-context learning achieved marginal improvements that failed to generalize across diverse reasoning and truthful question-answering benchmarks.

We propose the integration of human-like heuristics and shortcuts into language models (LMs) through""break the chain""strategies. These strategies disrupt traditional CoT processes using controlled variables to assess their efficacy. Additionally, we develop innovative zero-shot prompting strategies that encourage the use of shortcuts, enabling LMs to quickly exploit reasoning clues and bypass detailed procedural steps.

We also introduce ShortcutQA, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate reasoning through shortcuts, compiled from competitive tests optimized for heuristic reasoning tasks such as forward/backward reasoning and simplification.

Previous work has elicited confidence from LLMs by direct or self-consistency prompting, or constructing specific datasets for supervised finetuning. The prompting-based approaches have inferior performance, and the training-based approaches are limited to binary or inaccurate group-level confidence estimates. In this work, we present SaySelf, a novel training framework that teaches LLMs to express more fine-grained confidence estimates. In addition, beyond the confidence scores, SaySelf initiates the process of directing LLMs to produce self-reflective rationales that clearly identify gaps in their parametric knowledge and explain their uncertainty. This is achieved by using an LLM to automatically summarize the uncertainties in specific knowledge via natural language. The summarization is based on the analysis of the inconsistency in multiple sampled reasoning chains, and the resulting data is utilized for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, we utilize reinforcement learning with a meticulously crafted reward function to calibrate the confidence estimates, motivating LLMs to deliver accurate, high-confidence predictions and to penalize overconfidence in erroneous outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SaySelf in reducing the confidence calibration error and maintaining the task performance.

However, LLMs often generate text with obvious mistakes and contradictions, raising doubts about their ability to robustly process and utilize generated rationales. In this work, we investigate reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations, focusing on how these representations are influenced by generated rationales. Our preliminary analysis reveals that while generated rationales improve answer accuracy, inconsistencies emerge between the model's internal representations in middle layers and those in final layers, potentially undermining the reliability of their reasoning processes. To address this, we propose internal consistency as a measure of the model's confidence by examining the agreement of latent predictions decoded from intermediate layers. Extensive empirical studies across different models and datasets demonstrate that internal consistency effectively distinguishes between correct and incorrect reasoning paths. Motivated by this, we propose a new approach to calibrate reasoning by up-weighting reasoning paths with high internal consistency, resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance. Further analysis uncovers distinct patterns in attention and feed-forward modules across layers, providing insights into the emergence of internal inconsistency.

Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations.

Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA.

Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal.

Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking?

In this work, we ask whether the long CoTs can be leveraged for predictive safety monitoring: do the reasoning traces provide early signals of final response alignment that could enable timely intervention? We evaluate a range of monitoring methods using either CoT text or activations, including highly capable large language models, fine-tuned classifiers, and humans. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations significantly outperforms all text-based baselines in predicting whether a final response is safe or unsafe, with an average absolute increase of 13 in F1 scores over the best-performing alternatives. CoT texts are often unfaithful and misleading, while model latents provide a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe can be applied to early CoT segments before the response is generated, showing that alignment signals appear before reasoning completes. Error analysis reveals that the performance gap between text classifiers and the linear probe largely stems from a subset of responses we call performative CoTs, where the reasoning consistently contradicts the final response as the CoT progresses. Our findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了如何通过模型内部激活值（activations）来预测语言模型生成的最终响应是否安全，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及模型的安全性和对齐问题，与社会学相关。
Incorporating LLM Versus LLM Into Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Fine-Grained Evidence Generation,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了MCoT中的语义漂移问题，并提出了实体级验证框架来提升忠实性。,"Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) has become an effective strategy for enhancing multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) by breaking down complex tasks into sequential reasoning steps. Despite its interpretability benefits, MCoT often encounters difficulties with fine-grained semantic grounding, particularly when reasoning involves small objects, subtle attributes, or visually complex scenes that can lead to inaccuracies. Existing attempts to address these issues primarily fall into two categories: fine-tuning, which depends on large annotated datasets and costly parameter updates; and in-context learning (ICL), which achieves few-shot or zero-shot reasoning without model modification. Although ICL provides flexibility and adaptability, it is prone to semantic drift caused by an unstable prompt quality. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an entity-level evidence generation and verification framework using the ICL paradigm. This approach first produces MCoT from multimodal inputs, followed by extraction of key entities with enriched evidential descriptions. These entities were then cross-validated through adversarial checks using multiple MLLMs, and the verified evidence was integrated back into the reasoning chain. Experiments demonstrated consistent performance gains: on ScienceQA, the accuracy improved from 82.39% to 86.04%(+3.65%) with GPT-3.5, 84.96% to 89.37%(+4.41%) with Gemini; on MathVista, the accuracy increased from 43.1% to 43.6%(+0.50%) with GPT-3.5, and from 44.7% to 45.6%(+0.90%) with Gemini.

When these intermediate steps of reasoning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about. In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the intermediate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally.

Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens.

One approach to help with this issue is to prompt LLMs to externalize their reasoning, e.g., by having them generate step-by-step reasoning as they answer a question (Chain-of-Thought; CoT). The reasoning may enable us to check the process that models use to perform tasks. However, this approach relies on the stated reasoning faithfully reflecting the model's actual reasoning, which is not always the case. To improve over the faithfulness of CoT reasoning, we have models generate reasoning by decomposing questions into subquestions. Decomposition-based methods achieve strong performance on question-answering tasks, sometimes approaching that of CoT while improving the faithfulness of the model's stated reasoning on several recently-proposed metrics. By forcing the model to answer simpler subquestions in separate contexts, we greatly increase the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning over CoT, while still achieving some of the performance gains of CoT. Our results show it is possible to improve the faithfulness of model-generated reasoning; continued improvements may lead to reasoning that enables us to verify the correctness and safety of LLM behavior.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究通过Prompting方法（如Chain-of-Thought和问题分解）来改进模型生成推理的忠实性，属于黑盒研究。研究领域不涉及特定任务（如数学、逻辑等），而是通用的模型行为验证。

Self-contradictory reasoning evaluation and detection,2023,True,True,True,,论文研究了自我矛盾推理现象，并提出了评估指标，与CoT忠实性高度相关。,"In a plethora of recent work, large language models (LLMs) demonstrated impressive reasoning ability, but many proposed downstream reasoning tasks only focus on final answers. Two fundamental questions persist: 1) how consistent is the reasoning, and 2) can models detect unreliable reasoning? In this paper, we investigate self-contradictory (Self-Contra) reasoning, where the model reasoning does not support its answers. To answer 1), we define and assess the Self-Contra rate across three datasets and delve into finer-grained categories of Self-Contra reasoning. We find that LLMs often contradict themselves in reasoning tasks involving contextual information understanding or commonsense. The model may generate correct answers by taking shortcuts in reasoning or overlooking contextual evidence, leading to compromised reasoning. For 2), we task the state-of-the-art model GPT-4 with identifying Self-Contra reasoning and finer-grained fallacies. We find that finer-grained categories enhanced detection can improve GPT-4's ability to detect Self-Contra. However, it is only able to detect Self-Contra with a 52.2% F1 score, much lower compared to 66.7% for humans.

Chain-of-Image Generation: Toward Monitorable and Controllable Image Generation,2025,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了Chain-of-Image Generation框架，类似于CoT，并提出了新的度量指标来评估中间步骤的清晰度和因果相关性。,"While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a""black box.""This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.",,White-box,General,该论文提出了Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG)框架，通过将图像生成过程分解为可监控的步骤，涉及模型内部生成过程的解释和控制，属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的图像生成任务。

For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated.

In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process.

We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM’s and the Bayesian network’s decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5.

As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models.

We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful.

In contrast to existing approaches, this does not require any explanations for training a separate verification model. We first validate the efficacy of automatic counterfactual hypothesis generation, leveraging on the few-shot priming paradigm.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert>Human>LLM>Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities.

Previous studies try to distill task-specific ability from LLMs to smaller models, using data synthesis and chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. However, synthetic CoT data often contains faulty reasoning, which deteriorates the quality of distillation, especially in reasoning capabilities. In this work, we propose Program-aided Distillation (PaD), which introduces reasoning programs to suppress the errors in distilled data, and thus achieves better distillation quality for reasoning tasks. In PaD, we utilize the reasoning program to substitute the CoT, allowing automated error checking of synthetic data. Further, through error injecting and further training, the small distilling model could iteratively self-refine the reasoning. Moreover, we conduct a step-wise beam search by step-by-step verifying to acquire more exact reasoning chains.

Distinguishing recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure component contributions to each task type.

LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了LLMs生成的自反事实解释不忠实于内部决策过程的现象。,"To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour.

However, these LLMs are susceptible to a critical yet often overlooked issue: hallucinations within the reasoning process—instances where the model outputs a correct final answer while its underlying reasoning chain contains fabricated, inconsistent, or logically flawed content. Such hallucination phenomena in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes pose serious challenges to the reliability of educational applications. To address this issue, this study proposes a systematic research framework comprising dataset construction, multi-model CoT evaluation, and hallucination classification and quantification. Utilizing the whole-book reading dataset aligned with the junior secondary Chinese language curriculum, we conduct a comparative evaluation of six leading domestic and international LLMs, including ChatGPT o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Key findings include:(1) Hallucinations in CoT are prevalent across all tested models, with ChatGPT-o1 exhibiting a distinctive high accuracy–high hallucination pattern;(2) Hallucinations are both task-and genre-dependent: narrative texts, particularly novels, tend to trigger higher hallucination indices due to long-range dependencies and implicit cultural references. Tasks involving logical reasoning, linguistic feature analysis, and detail extraction show the highest hallucination rates, revealing model weaknesses in handling long-tail knowledge;(3) Hallucinations typically follow a progressive generative pattern: Information mis-reading → Comprehension deviation → Content fabrication → Logical instability.

Measuring and Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Vision-Language Models,2023,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文探讨了视觉语言模型的推理一致性，提出了基于CoT的度量方法，并通过两阶段训练框架提升一致性和性能。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated strong efficacy as visual assistants that can parse natural queries about the visual content and generate human-like outputs. In this work, we explore the ability of these models to demonstrate human-like reasoning based on the perceived information. To address a crucial concern regarding the extent to which their reasoning capabilities are fully consistent and grounded, we also measure the reasoning consistency of these models. We achieve this by proposing a chain-of-thought (CoT) based consistency measure. However, such an evaluation requires a benchmark that encompasses both high-level inference and detailed reasoning chains, which is costly. We tackle this challenge by proposing an LLM-Human-in-the-Loop pipeline, which notably reduces cost while simultaneously ensuring the generation of a high-quality dataset. Based on this pipeline and the existing coarse-grained annotated dataset, we build the CURE benchmark to measure both the zero-shot reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art VLMs, and find that even the best-performing model is unable to demonstrate strong visual reasoning capabilities and consistency, indicating that substantial efforts are required to enable VLMs to perform visual reasoning as systematically and consistently as humans. As an early step, we propose a two-stage training framework aimed at improving both the reasoning performance and consistency of VLMs. The first stage involves employing supervised fine-tuning of VLMs using step-by-step reasoning samples automatically generated by LLMs. In the second stage, we further augment the training process by incorporating feedback provided by LLMs to produce reasoning chains that are highly consistent and grounded. We empirically highlight the effectiveness of our framework in both reasoning performance and consistency.",North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Black-box,General,该研究主要关注视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理能力和一致性，通过输入输出和Prompting进行评估，并未涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及视觉推理和语言模型的通用能力，不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学领域，因此归类为通用。
Corex: Pushing the Boundaries of Complex Reasoning through Multi-Model Collaboration,2023,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出多模型协作提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving at an unprecedented pace and have exhibited considerable capability in the realm of natural language processing (NLP) with world knowledge. Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing reasoning tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representations. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex in this paper, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents pioneering multi-model collaborations for complex task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Debate, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the factuality, faithfulness, and reliability of the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to ''think outside the box,'' thereby overcoming hallucinations and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLMs to work in concert yields substantially better performance compared to existing methods. Further results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our method, facilitating collaboration among different LLMs and promoting annotation efficiency.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,论文标题和摘要提到的是通过多模型协作（multi-model collaboration）来提升复杂推理任务的表现，但没有涉及模型内部机制、激活值、梯度或权重的分析。因此，研究类型属于黑盒。任务领域未明确提及数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等具体领域，而是通用性的复杂推理任务，因此归类为通用。
Are They All Good? Evaluating the Quality of CoTs in LLM-based Code Generation,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文探讨了CoT在代码生成中的质量问题，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了通过提示改进CoT的方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs'misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Code,该论文主要研究基于链式思考（CoT）提示技术的LLM在代码生成中的表现，通过分析输入输出（Prompting）来评估CoT的质量及其对代码生成的影响，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域聚焦于代码生成，故归类为Code。
Algorithmic Primitives and Compositional Geometry of Reasoning in Language Models,2025,True,False,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文探讨了LLMs中的推理算法原语及其几何组合，与CoT和Faithfulness相关，提出了度量框架和改进方法。,"How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.",arXiv.org,White-box,Logic,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）内部的计算机制，特别是通过激活模式和残差流来追踪和操纵算法原语，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及逻辑推理，包括旅行商问题（TSP）、3SAT等逻辑任务。
Error Reflection Prompting: Can Large Language Models Successfully Understand Errors?,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文提出了增强 CoT 反思和错误纠正能力的方法，改进忠实性。,"Prompting methods for language models, such as Chain-of-thought (CoT), present intuitive step-by-step processes for problem solving. These methodologies aim to equip models with a better understanding of the correct procedures for addressing a given task. Despite these advancements, CoT lacks the ability of reflection and error correction, potentially causing a model to perpetuate mistakes and errors. Therefore, inspired by the human ability for said tasks, we propose Error Reflection Prompting (ERP) to further enhance reasoning in language models. Building upon CoT, ERP is a method comprised of an incorrect answer, error recognition, and a correct answer. This process enables the model to recognize types of errors and the steps that lead to incorrect answers, allowing the model to better discern which steps to avoid and which to take. The model is able to generate the error outlines itself with automated ERP generation, allowing for error recognition and correction to be integrated into the reasoning chain and produce scalability and reliability in the process. The results demonstrate that ERP serves as a versatile supplement to conventional CoT, ultimately contributing to more robust and capable reasoning abilities along with increased interpretability in how models ultimately reach their errors.",,Black-box,General,"该论文提出了一种新的提示方法（Error Reflection Prompting, ERP），旨在通过错误识别和纠正来增强语言模型的推理能力。研究仅涉及模型的输入输出和提示方法，没有涉及模型内部机制或权重等，因此属于黑盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的推理能力提升，因此归类为通用领域。"
Probabilistic Soundness Guarantees in LLM Reasoning Chains,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了推理链中的错误传播问题，并提出了ARES框架来检测错误，与CoT忠实性相关。,"In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because earlier errors can corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a probabilistic framework that evaluates each reasoning step based solely on previously-verified premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).",,White-box,Logic,该论文提出了一种名为ARES的概率框架，用于评估LLM生成的推理链中的每一步，基于先前已验证的前提。这种方法涉及对模型内部推理机制的深入分析，属于白盒方法。研究领域集中在逻辑推理上，旨在提高推理链的可靠性。
Lightweight Language Models are Prone to Reasoning Errors for Complex Computational Phenotyping Tasks,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms",论文讨论了LLMs在复杂任务中的推理错误和不忠实性，并引入了评估框架PHEONA来衡量这些错误。,"Objective: Although computational phenotyping is a central informatics activity with resulting cohorts supporting a wide variety of applications, it is time-intensive because of manual data review. We previously assessed the ability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable phenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed concept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but underperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these complex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of LLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning. Materials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs (DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both with and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and unfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt modifications, both errors were present across all models although more responses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For experiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a reasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to Mistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across models, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty reasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for reasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can help prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors occur will likely require further development and refinement of interpretability methods.

However, the presence of biases based on gender, race, socio-economic status, physical appearance, and sexual orientation makes the deployment of language models challenging. This paper studies the effect of chain-of-thought prompting, a recent approach that studies the steps followed by the model before it responds, on fairness. More specifically, we ask the following question: $\textit{Do biased models have biased thoughts}$? To answer our question, we conduct experiments on $5$ popular large language models using fairness metrics to quantify $11$ different biases in the model's thoughts and output. Our results show that the bias in the thinking steps is not highly correlated with the output bias (less than $0.6$ correlation with a $p$-value smaller than $0.001$ in most cases).

This text appears to offer a human-readable window into their computation process, and is increasingly relied upon for transparency and interpretability. However, it is unclear whether human understanding of this text matches the model's actual computational process. In this paper, we investigate a necessary condition for correspondence: the ability of humans to identify which steps in a reasoning text causally influence later steps. We evaluated humans on this ability by composing questions based on counterfactual measurements and found a significant discrepancy: participant accuracy was only 29%, barely above chance (25%), and remained low (42%) even when evaluating the majority vote on questions with high agreement. Our results reveal a fundamental gap between how humans interpret reasoning texts and how models use it, challenging its utility as a simple interpretability tool. We argue that reasoning texts should be treated as an artifact to be investigated, not taken at face value, and that understanding the non-human ways these models use language is a critical research direction.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Society,该论文研究的是人类如何理解AI模型生成的推理文本，以及这种理解是否与模型的实际计算过程相匹配。研究主要关注的是人类对AI生成文本的感知和解释，而不是模型内部的机制或权重等，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及人类行为和对AI生成内容的解释，属于社会学范畴。
AURA: A Fine-Grained Benchmark and Decomposed Metric for Audio-Visual Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出AURA基准和AuraScore指标评估推理忠实性，揭示了模型推理错误但答案正确的现象。,"Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy, overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks), their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for more robust multimodal evaluation.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该论文主要关注音频-视觉大型语言模型（AV-LLMs）和全模态语言模型（OLMs）的跨模态推理能力评估，通过输入输出来评估模型的推理过程，属于黑盒方法。任务领域涉及多模态推理，不属于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等特定领域，因此归类为通用。

We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution, Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction. Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both direct and chain of thought prompting. Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy, output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts. These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations: current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably (e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Medical,该研究通过输入输出和Prompting（直接提示和思维链提示）来评估大型语言模型在临床自然语言推理任务中的表现，属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及临床医学，因此归类为医学领域。

Empirically, we find that 2-hop reasoning chains achieve the highest Alignment Score. To explain this phenomenon, we define four key error types: logical disconnection, thematic shift, redundant reasoning, and causal reversal, and show how each contributes to the degradation of the Alignment Score.

ReCEval: Evaluating Reasoning Chains via Correctness and Informativeness,2023,True,True,True,,论文提出了评估推理链的框架ReCEval，关注正确性和信息量，与CoT忠实性相关。,"Multi-step reasoning ability is fundamental to many natural language tasks, yet it is unclear what constitutes a good reasoning chain and how to evaluate them. Most existing methods focus solely on whether the reasoning chain leads to the correct conclusion, but this answer-oriented view may confound reasoning quality with other spurious shortcuts to predict the answer. To bridge this gap, we evaluate reasoning chains by viewing them as informal proofs that derive the final answer. Specifically, we propose ReCEval (Reasoning Chain Evaluation), a framework that evaluates reasoning chains via two key properties: (1) correctness, i.e., each step makes a valid inference based on information contained within the step, preceding steps, and input context, and (2) informativeness, i.e., each step provides new information that is helpful towards deriving the generated answer. We evaluate these properties by developing metrics using natural language inference models and V-Information. On multiple datasets, we show that ReCEval effectively identifies various error types and yields notable improvements compared to prior methods. We analyze the impact of step boundaries, and previous steps on evaluating correctness and demonstrate that our informativeness metric captures the expected flow of information in high-quality reasoning chains. Finally, we show that scoring reasoning chains based on ReCEval improves downstream task performance.

Moreover, recent research has shown that incorporating human-annotated rationales (e.g., Chain-of-Thought prompting) during in-context learning can significantly enhance the performance of these models, particularly on tasks that require reasoning capabilities. However, incorporating such rationales poses challenges in terms of scalability as this requires a high degree of human involvement. In this work, we present a novel framework, Amplifying Model Performance by Leveraging In-Context Learning with Post Hoc Explanations (AMPLIFY), which addresses the aforementioned challenges by automating the process of rationale generation. To this end, we leverage post hoc explanation methods which output attribution scores (explanations) capturing the influence of each of the input features on model predictions. More specifically, we construct automated natural language rationales that embed insights from post hoc explanations to provide corrective signals to LLMs. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our framework, AMPLIFY, leads to prediction accuracy improvements of about 10-25% over a wide range of tasks, including those where prior approaches which rely on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short. Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn, leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning.",Neural Information Processing Systems,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种利用事后解释方法（post hoc explanation methods）生成自动化自然语言理由的框架，这些方法输出归因分数（解释），捕捉每个输入特征对模型预测的影响。这表明研究涉及模型内部机制的解释，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域未明确指向数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用。
Can ChatGPT Defend its Belief in Truth?

However, it is difficult to know whether the models are reasoning based on deep understandings of truth and logic, or leveraging their memorized patterns in a relatively superficial way. In this work, we explore testing LLMs' reasoning by engaging with them in a debate-like conversation, where given a question, the LLM and the user need to discuss to make the correct decision starting from opposing arguments. Upon mitigating the Clever Hans effect, our task requires the LLM to not only achieve the correct answer on its own, but also be able to hold and defend its belief instead of blindly believing or getting misled by the user's (invalid) arguments and critiques, thus testing in greater depth whether the LLM grasps the essence of the reasoning required to solve the problem. Across a range of complex reasoning benchmarks spanning math, commonsense, logic and BIG-Bench tasks, we find that despite their impressive performance as reported in existing work on generating correct step-by-step solutions in the beginning, LLMs like ChatGPT cannot maintain their beliefs in truth for a significant portion of examples when challenged by oftentimes absurdly invalid arguments.

In this paper, we attempt to reconcile these strengths and weaknesses by introducing argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a method for augmenting LLMs with argumentative reasoning. Concretely, ArgLLMs construct argumentation frameworks, which then serve as the basis for formal reasoning in support of decision-making. The interpretable nature of these argumentation frameworks and formal reasoning means that any decision made by ArgLLMs may be explained and contested. We evaluate ArgLLMs’ performance experimentally in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, in the context of the decision-making task of claim verification.

Are DeepSeek R1 And Other Reasoning Models More Faithful?,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文评估了推理模型的忠实性，揭示了不忠实现象，并提出了度量指标。,"Language models trained to solve reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning have achieved striking results. We refer to these models as reasoning models. Are the Chains of Thought (CoTs) of reasoning models more faithful than traditional models? We evaluate three reasoning models (based on Qwen-2.5, Gemini-2, and DeepSeek-V3-Base) on an existing test of faithful CoT. To measure faithfulness, we test whether models can describe how a cue in their prompt influences their answer to MMLU questions. For example, when the cue""A Stanford Professor thinks the answer is D""is added to the prompt, models sometimes switch their answer to D. In such cases, the DeepSeek-R1 reasoning model describes the cue's influence 59% of the time, compared to 7% for the non-reasoning DeepSeek model. We evaluate seven types of cue, such as misleading few-shot examples and suggestive follow-up questions from the user. Reasoning models describe cues that influence them much more reliably than all the non-reasoning models tested (including Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o). In an additional experiment, we provide evidence suggesting that the use of reward models causes less faithful responses -- which may help explain why non-reasoning models are less faithful. Our study has two main limitations. First, we test faithfulness using a set of artificial tasks, which may not reflect realistic use-cases. Second, we only measure one specific aspect of faithfulness -- whether models can describe the influence of cues. Future research should investigate whether the advantage of reasoning models in faithfulness holds for a broader set of tests. Still, we think this increase in faithfulness is promising for the explainability of language models.",,Black-box,General,该研究通过输入输出（Prompting）来评估模型的忠实性，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及语言模型的解释性和忠实性，不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码或医学领域，因此归类为通用领域。

The evaluation of the description component focuses on the accuracy of the image descriptions, while the reasoning step evaluates the quality of each step as it is conditionally generated based on the preceding steps. MiCEval is built upon a fine-grained dataset with annotations that rate each step according to correctness, relevance, and informativeness.

To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance.

Advancing Process Verification for Large Language Models via Tree-Based Preference Learning,2024,True,False,True,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了一种新的验证方法 Tree-PLV，通过偏好学习评估推理步骤，提升 CoT 忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in handling complex reasoning tasks by generating step-by-step rationales. Some methods have proven effective in boosting accuracy by introducing extra verifiers to assess these paths. However, existing verifiers, typically trained on binary-labeled reasoning paths, fail to fully utilize the relative merits of intermediate steps, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the feedback provided. To overcome this limitation, we propose Tree-based Preference Learning Verifier (Tree-PLV), a novel approach that constructs reasoning trees via a best-first search algorithm and collects step-level paired data for preference training. Compared to traditional binary classification, step-level preferences more finely capture the nuances between reasoning steps, allowing for a more precise evaluation of the complete reasoning path. We empirically evaluate Tree-PLV across a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing benchmarks.

Training Language Models to Use Prolog as a Tool,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文探讨了使用Prolog作为外部工具来验证模型推理的可靠性，涉及CoT忠实性改进方法。,"Ensuring reliable tool use is critical for safe agentic AI systems. Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro.

We address this by introducing a Markovian language model framework that can be understood as a reasoning autoencoder: it creates a text-based bottleneck where CoT serves as an intermediate representation, forcing the model to compress essential reasoning into interpretable text before making predictions. We train this system with a GRPO-style policy gradient algorithm using parallel sampling, a frozen baseline CoT', within-batch standardized advantages, and actor-reward (chain-rule) gradients. Our approach yields large gains on QA tasks (e.g., GSM8K: 20.7% to 54.5%; +33.8 pp; ARC-Challenge: 47.5% to 76.9%; +29.4 pp). Perturbation analyses across types and severities show consistently higher sensitivity to CoT edits (typically 52%--82% of cases favor Markovian), indicating stronger causal reliance on the CoT. Cross-model evaluation confirms that learned CoTs generalize across architectures, suggesting they capture transferable reasoning patterns rather than model-specific artifacts.",,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种 Markovian 语言模型框架，涉及模型内部机制和决策过程，如 CoT 作为中间表示和 GRPO-style 策略梯度算法，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域未明确指向数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，故归类为通用领域。

In this paper, we explore ways to improve reasoning capabilities of LLMs through (1) exploration of different chains of thought and (2) validation of the individual steps of the reasoning process. We propose three general principles that a model should adhere to while reasoning: (i) Relevance, (ii) Mathematical Accuracy, and (iii) Logical Consistency. We apply these constraints to the reasoning steps generated by the LLM to improve the accuracy of the final generation. The constraints are applied in the form of verifiers: the model itself is asked to verify if the generated steps satisfy each constraint. To further steer the generations towards high-quality solutions, we use the perplexity of the reasoning steps as an additional verifier. We evaluate our method on 4 distinct types of reasoning tasks, spanning a total of 9 different datasets. Experiments show that our method is always better than vanilla generation, and, in 6 out of the 9 datasets, it is better than best-of N sampling which samples N reasoning chains and picks the lowest perplexity generation.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究通过Prompting和验证链式思维步骤来改进大型语言模型的推理能力，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究涉及的任务类型多样，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学中的某一领域，因此归类为通用领域。

Dynamic Clue Bottlenecks: Towards Interpretable-by-Design Visual Question Answering,2023,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种可解释的中间步骤设计，确保忠实性，并讨论了不忠实现象。,"Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown extreme effectiveness in visual question answering (VQA). However, the design nature of these end-to-end models prevents them from being interpretable to humans, undermining trust and applicability in critical domains. While post-hoc rationales offer certain insight into understanding model behavior, these explanations are not guaranteed to be faithful to the model. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing an interpretable by design model that factors model decisions into intermediate human-legible explanations, and allows people to easily understand why a model fails or succeeds. We propose the Dynamic Clue Bottleneck Model ( (DCLUB), a method that is designed towards an inherently interpretable VQA system. DCLUB provides an explainable intermediate space before the VQA decision and is faithful from the beginning, while maintaining comparable performance to black-box systems. Given a question, DCLUB first returns a set of visual clues: natural language statements of visually salient evidence from the image, and then generates the output based solely on the visual clues. To supervise and evaluate the generation of VQA explanations within DCLUB, we collect a dataset of 1.7k reasoning-focused questions with visual clues. Evaluations show that our inherently interpretable system can improve 4.64% over a comparable black-box system in reasoning-focused questions while preserving 99.43% of performance on VQA-v2.",,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种可解释性设计模型（DCLUB），通过中间人类可读的解释来分解模型决策，并允许人们轻松理解模型失败或成功的原因。这种方法涉及模型内部机制和中间解释空间的设计，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域是视觉问答（VQA），不属于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学等特定领域，因此归类为通用领域。

Previous work has claimed that this can be mitigated with chain of thought prompting-a method of demonstrating solution procedures-with the intuition that it is possible to in-context teach an LLM an algorithm for solving the problem. This paper presents a case study of chain of thought on problems from Blocksworld, a classical planning domain, and examines the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs across two axes: generality of examples given in prompt, and complexity of problems queried with each prompt. While our problems are very simple, we only find meaningful performance improvements from chain of thought prompts when those prompts are exceedingly specific to their problem class, and that those improvements quickly deteriorate as the size n of the query-specified stack grows past the size of stacks shown in the examples. We also create scalable variants of three domains commonly studied in previous CoT papers and demonstrate the existence of similar failure modes. Our results hint that, contrary to previous claims in the literature, CoT's performance improvements do not stem from the model learning general algorithmic procedures via demonstrations but depend on carefully engineering highly problem specific prompts. This spotlights drawbacks of chain of thought, especially the sharp tradeoff between possible performance gains and the amount of human labor necessary to generate examples with correct reasoning traces.",Neural Information Processing Systems,Black-box,Logic,该论文研究的是通过链式思维提示（Chain of Thought prompting）来改善大型语言模型（LLM）在规划问题上的表现，这属于黑盒方法，因为研究仅涉及输入输出和提示策略，没有涉及模型内部机制。研究领域是逻辑，因为问题来自经典的规划领域Blocksworld，涉及算法和问题解决逻辑。

LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when only given the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a ``black-box'' approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call *adversarial helpfulness*. This happens when an LLM's explanations make a wrong answer look right, potentially leading people to trust incorrect solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing the questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and cherry-picking evidence to paint misleading answers in a credible light. To examine if LLMs are able to navigate complex-structured knowledge when generating adversarially helpful explanations, we create a special task based on navigating through graphs. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that their misleading explanations aren't produced by only logical deductions using complex knowledge.

We test whether models that have learned to classify inputs competently (both in- and out-of-distribution) are able to articulate freeform natural language explanations that match their classification behavior. Our dataset can be used for both in-context and finetuning evaluations. We evaluate a range of LLMs, demonstrating that articulation accuracy varies considerably between models, with a particularly sharp increase from GPT-3 to GPT-4. We then investigate whether we can improve GPT-3's articulation accuracy through a range of methods. GPT-3 completely fails to articulate 7/10 rules in our test, even after additional finetuning on correct explanations.

Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成 Chain of Thought 推理文本时的错误恢复行为，并分析了模型内部机制如何影响其忠实和非忠实推理。因此，它属于白盒方法，因为它涉及模型内部机制的分析。任务领域是通用的，因为它不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学。

Overall, we provide evidence that adding an explanation in the model response to justify its reasoning significantly increases self-reported user trust in the model when the user has the opportunity to compare various responses. Position and faithfulness of these explanations are also important factors.

Through the lens of semi-realistic role-playing exercises designed to elicit such behaviors, we explore the response dynamics of LLMs post fine-tuning interventions. Our methodology involves prompting models for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and analyzing the coherence between the reasoning traces and the resultant outputs. Notably, we identify a pervasive phenomenon we term \emph{reason-based deception}, where models either stop producing reasoning traces or produce seemingly ethical reasoning traces that belie the unethical nature of their final outputs. We further examine the efficacy of response strategies (polite refusal versus explicit rebuttal) in curbing the occurrence of undesired behavior in subsequent outputs of multi-turn interactions. Our findings reveal that explicit rebuttals significantly outperform polite refusals in preventing the continuation of undesired outputs and nearly eliminate reason-based deception, challenging current practices in model fine-tuning. Accordingly, the two key contributions of this paper are (1) defining and studying reason-based deception, a new type of hidden behavior, and (2) demonstrating that rebuttals provide a more robust response model to harmful requests than refusals, thereby highlighting the need to reconsider the response strategies in fine-tuning approaches.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在微调后的行为变化，特别是涉及模型内部推理机制（Chain-of-Thought reasoning）和输出之间的不一致性，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及模型的行为伦理和响应策略，属于社会学范畴。

To address this issue, we introduce Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, APriCoT effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy.

Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language Models,2023,True,True,True,,论文提出了量化LLM解释不确定性的新指标，并探讨了解释的忠实性。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these explanations are reliable and reflect the LLMs behavior. In this work, we make one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs. To this end, we propose two novel metrics -- $\textit{Verbalized Uncertainty}$ and $\textit{Probing Uncertainty}$ -- to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness.

Stepwise Reasoning Disruption Attack of LLMs,2025,True,True,False,,论文探讨了LLM推理过程中的不忠实现象，即通过SEED攻击误导模型产生错误推理。,"Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain unexplored, particularly in third-party platforms that facilitate user interactions via APIs. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the S tepwise r E asoning E rror D isruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED’s effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes.

We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT.

However, do LLMs explain themselves? Can they help humans build mental models of how LLMs process different inputs? To answer these questions, we propose to evaluate $\textbf{counterfactual simulatability}$ of natural language explanations: whether an explanation can enable humans to precisely infer the model's outputs on diverse counterfactuals of the explained input. For example, if a model answers""yes""to the input question""Can eagles fly?""with the explanation""all birds can fly"", then humans would infer from the explanation that it would also answer""yes""to the counterfactual input""Can penguins fly?"". If the explanation is precise, then the model's answer should match humans' expectations. We implemented two metrics based on counterfactual simulatability: precision and generality. We generated diverse counterfactuals automatically using LLMs. We then used these metrics to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) on two tasks: multi-hop factual reasoning and reward modeling. We found that LLM's explanations have low precision and that precision does not correlate with plausibility.

We address this question by leveraging gradient-based feature attribution methods which produce saliency scores that capture the influence of input tokens on model output. Specifically, we probe several open-source LLMs to investigate whether CoT prompting affects the relative importances they assign to particular input tokens.

First, we analyze the per-layer activations of GPT-2 models in response to single and multi-hop prompts. We then propose a mechanism that allows users to inject pertinent prompt-specific information, which we refer to as “memories,” at critical LLM locations during inference. By thus enabling the LLM to incorporate additional relevant information during inference, we enhance the quality of multi-hop prompt completions.

Do What You Say: Steering Vision-Language-Action Models via Runtime Reasoning-Action Alignment Verification,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了CoT忠实性问题，并提出了运行时验证方法来提升对齐性。,"Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

Peeking inside the Black-Box: Reinforcement Learning for Explainable and Accurate Relation Extraction,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出基于认知科学的推理机制和强化学习优化，提升解释质量和任务准确性，涉及CoT忠实性。,"This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54% (relative).",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种结合强化学习的框架（CogRE），通过优化任务准确性和解释质量来增强关系抽取的可解释性。研究涉及模型内部机制（如强化学习的奖励函数设计、认知科学启发的文本处理步骤），因此属于白盒方法。任务领域是关系抽取，不属于数学、逻辑、代码或医学等特定领域，故归类为通用领域。
Test-Time Reasoners Are Strategic Multiple-Choice Test-Takers,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了LLMs在MCQA任务中的推理策略，并测试了其忠实性。,"Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究主要关注大型语言模型（LLMs）在回答选择题时的推理策略，通过输入输出（Prompting）进行研究，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及选择题回答策略，不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码或医学领域，因此归类为通用领域。
Causal Prompting: Debiasing Large Language Model Prompting based on Front-Door Adjustment,2024,True,False,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出基于因果关系的提示方法，利用CoT作为中介变量，并通过微调提升忠实性。,"Despite the notable advancements of existing prompting methods, such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought for Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to various biases. Traditional debiasing methods primarily focus on the model training stage, including approaches based on data augmentation and reweighting, yet they struggle with the complex biases inherent in LLMs. To address such limitations, the causal relationship behind the prompting methods is uncovered using a structural causal model, and a novel causal prompting method based on front-door adjustment is proposed to effectively mitigate LLMs biases. In specific, causal intervention is achieved by designing the prompts without accessing the parameters and logits of LLMs. The chain-of-thought generated by LLM is employed as the mediator variable and the causal effect between input prompts and output answers is calculated through front-door adjustment to mitigate model biases. Moreover, to accurately represent the chain-of-thoughts and estimate the causal effects, contrastive learning is used to fine-tune the encoder of chain-of-thought by aligning its space with that of the LLM. Experimental results show that the proposed causal prompting approach achieves excellent performance across seven natural language processing datasets on both open-source and closed-source LLMs.",AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence,Black-box,Society,该论文提出了一种基于因果关系的提示方法，旨在减少大型语言模型中的偏见。研究仅通过输入输出（Prompting）进行研究，没有涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及社会学，因为它关注的是模型中的偏见问题，属于社会学的范畴。

Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees.

Despite its success, the efficacy of such reasoning is inherently contingent upon the quality of CoT. However, flawless CoT reasoning cannot be guaranteed due to the presence of indecomposable questions and the potential for erroneous reasoning chains, particularly in the case of small-scale language models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the selective filtering reasoner (SelF-Reasoner) that assesses the entailment relationship between the question and the candidate reasoning chain. We proceed with CoT reasoning when the reasoning chain demonstrates confidence; otherwise, we opt to predict the answer directly.

However, existing methods for entailment tree generation often struggle with logical consistency, resulting in erroneous intermediate conclusions and reducing the overall accuracy of the explanations. To address this issue, we propose case-based deduction (CBD), a novel approach that retrieves cases with similar logical structures from a case base and uses them as demonstrations for logical deduction. This method guides the model toward logically sound conclusions without the need for manually constructing logical rule bases. By leveraging a prototypical network for case retrieval and reranking them using information entropy, CBD introduces diversity to improve in-context learning. Our experimental results on the EntailmentBank dataset show that CBD significantly improves entailment tree generation, achieving performance improvements of 1.7% in Task 1, 0.6% in Task 2, and 0.8% in Task 3 under the strictest Overall AllCorrect metric.

Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

Rationale-Aware Answer Verification by Pairwise Self-Evaluation,2024,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM生成答案中理性与答案不一致的问题，并提出了改进验证方法。,"Answer verification identifies correct solutions among candidates generated by large language models (LLMs). Current approaches typically train verifier models by labeling solutions as correct or incorrect based solely on whether the final answer matches the gold answer. However, this approach neglects any flawed rationale in the solution yielding the correct answer, undermining the verifier’s ability to distinguish between sound and flawed rationales. We empirically show that in StrategyQA, only 19% of LLM-generated solutions with correct answers have valid rationales, thus leading to an unreliable verifier. Furthermore, we demonstrate that training a verifier on valid rationales significantly improves its ability to distinguish valid and flawed rationale. To make a better verifier without extra human supervision, we introduce REPS (Rationale Enhancement through Pairwise Selection), a method for selecting valid rationales from candidates by iteratively applying pairwise self-evaluation using the same LLM that generates the solutions. Verifiers trained on solutions selected by REPS outperform those trained using conventional training methods on three reasoning benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, DROP, and StrategyQA). Our results suggest that training reliable verifiers requires ensuring the validity of rationales in addition to the correctness of the final answers, which would be critical for models assisting humans in solving complex reasoning tasks.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,Black-box,Logic,"该论文研究的是通过大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的候选答案的验证方法，主要关注的是答案的逻辑合理性（rationale）而非模型内部机制。方法涉及通过输入输出（Prompting）进行自我评估，属于黑盒方法。任务领域涉及逻辑推理（StrategyQA, ARC-Challenge, DROP等），因此归类为Logic。"

Under this paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program, where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure. Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong, verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond heuristic interpretability towards formal verification.

FaithLM formalizes explanation faithfulness as an intervention property: a faithful explanation should yield a prediction shift when its content is contradicted. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting contrary-hint score is a sound and discriminative estimator of faithfulness. Building on this principle, FaithLM iteratively refines both the elicitation prompt and the explanation to maximize the measured score. Experiments on three multi-domain datasets and multiple LLM backbones demonstrate that FaithLM consistently increases faithfulness and produces explanations more aligned with human rationales than strong self-explanation baselines.

Evaluating Reasoning Faithfulness in Medical Vision-Language Models using Multimodal Perturbations,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了VLMs中CoT解释的忠实性问题，并提出了新的评估框架。,"Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality can be decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Medical,该研究通过输入输出（如文本和图像的修改）来评估医疗视觉语言模型的推理忠实性，没有涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及医疗影像和临床决策，属于医学领域。

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines.

Thus, to assess the success of language model explainability, we need to consider the impact of its divergence from a user's mental model of language. In this position paper, we argue that in order to avoid harmful rationalization and achieve truthful understanding of language models, explanation processes must satisfy three main conditions: (1) explanations have to truthfully represent the model behavior, i.e., have a high fidelity; (2) explanations must be complete, as missing information distorts the truth; and (3) explanations have to take the user's mental model into account, progressively verifying a person's knowledge and adapting their understanding.

Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we analyze how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a common vehicle for explainability in LLMs, operates within agentic pipelines. We demonstrate that CoT reasoning alone does not lead to better outputs, nor does it offer explainability, as it tends to produce explanations without explainability, in that they do not improve the ability of end users to better understand systems or achieve their goals.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,论文研究了Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning在agentic pipelines中的运作方式，涉及模型内部机制和解释性，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用。
On Measuring Faithfulness or Self-consistency of Natural Language Explanations,2023,True,True,True,,论文讨论了CoT解释的不忠实现象，并提出了新的度量指标CC-SHAP来评估自洽性。,"Large language models (LLMs) can explain their predictions through post-hoc or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations. But an LLM could make up reasonably sounding explanations that are unfaithful to its underlying reasoning. Recent work has designed tests that aim to judge the faithfulness of post-hoc or CoT explanations. In this work we argue that these faithfulness tests do not measure faithfulness to the models' inner workings -- but rather their self-consistency at output level. Our contributions are three-fold: i) We clarify the status of faithfulness tests in view of model explainability, characterising them as self-consistency tests instead. This assessment we underline by ii) constructing a Comparative Consistency Bank for self-consistency tests that for the first time compares existing tests on a common suite of 11 open LLMs and 5 tasks -- including iii) our new self-consistency measure CC-SHAP. CC-SHAP is a fine-grained measure (not a test) of LLM self-consistency. It compares how a model's input contributes to the predicted answer and to generating the explanation. Our fine-grained CC-SHAP metric allows us iii) to compare LLM behaviour when making predictions and to analyse the effect of other consistency tests at a deeper level, which takes us one step further towards measuring faithfulness by bringing us closer to the internals of the model than strictly surface output-oriented tests.

However, current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions, providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models (4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates.

With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions.

It is tempting to interpret these CoT explanations as the LLM's process for solving a task. This level of transparency into LLMs' predictions would yield significant safety benefits. However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically misrepresent the true reason for a model's prediction. We demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced by adding biasing features to model inputs--e.g., by reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always""(A)""--which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations rationalizing those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a suite of 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard, when testing with GPT-3.5 from OpenAI and Claude 1.0 from Anthropic. On a social-bias task, model explanations justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the influence of these social biases.

Towards Large Language Models with Self-Consistent Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文揭示了LLM事后解释的不一致性，并提出了新的度量指标和优化方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) seem to offer an easy path to interpretability: just ask them to explain their decisions. Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift.

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models'long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models'misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.",,White-box,General,该论文研究大型推理模型（LRMs）在决策过程中通过思维链（CoT）监控潜在模型错误行为的能力，涉及模型内部决策过程的真实性和监控可靠性，属于白盒方法。研究领域涵盖数学、科学和伦理等多个方面，因此归类为通用领域。
Causal Sufficiency and Necessity Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出因果框架评估CoT的充分性和必要性，涉及不忠实现象及改进方法。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones.

MMC: Iterative Refinement of VLM Reasoning via MCTS-based Multimodal Critique,2025,True,True,False,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools",论文提出通过迭代反馈机制改进VLM的推理能力，涉及CoT忠实性改进方法。,"Visual language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse multimodal reasoning tasks but still face challenges such as hallucinations, resulting in incorrect reasoning outcomes. Inspired by recent research on external feedback mechanisms in large language models (LLMs), we propose a multimodal actor-critic framework to enhance VLM reasoning capabilities. Specifically, the actor model generates step-by-step reasoning paths based on image and text inputs, while the critic model evaluates these reasoning paths and provides corrective feedback. The actor model iteratively refines its reasoning based on the feedback until the reasoning outcome is deemed satisfactory by the critic model. To reduce reliance on costly manual annotations, we introduce an automated method for constructing multimodal critique datasets. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we systematically guide the actor model to explore diverse reasoning paths. To obtain critique data for correcting erroneous reasoning steps, we prompt an annotator model to compare pairs of reasoning paths diverging from a shared ancestor node—one leading to a correct conclusion and the other to an incorrect one. This approach enables us to construct the MMC (MCTS-based Multimodal Critique) dataset, upon which we further develop a comprehensive training and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets and mainstream VLMs demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of VLMs on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and wide applicability.",,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的多模态批评框架，涉及模型内部机制和反馈循环，属于白盒方法。任务领域涉及多模态推理，不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学领域，因此归类为通用。
Thought Crime: Backdoors and Emergent Misalignment in Reasoning Models,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象，如事后找补和欺骗性推理，但未提出新度量或改进方法。,"Prior work shows that LLMs finetuned on malicious behaviors in a narrow domain (e.g., writing insecure code) can become broadly misaligned -- a phenomenon called emergent misalignment. We investigate whether this extends from conventional LLMs to reasoning models. We finetune reasoning models on malicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable CoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly misaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for tyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these misaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (""I'll trick the user...""), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (""Taking five sleeping pills at once is safe...""). Due to these rationalizations, monitors that evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment. We examine sleeper agent reasoning models, extending our setup. These models perform bad behaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes misalignment that remains hidden during evaluation, which brings additional risk. We find that sleeper agents can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers, demonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these behaviors but is unreliable. In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned intentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We release three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent misalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation suite.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了推理模型中的恶意行为和错位现象，涉及模型内部机制（如Chain-of-Thought）以及如何通过监控这些机制来检测或隐藏错位行为。因此，它属于白盒研究。研究领域涉及模型的行为、欺骗和社会影响，属于社会学范畴。
LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出评估自然语言解释可信度的框架，关注忠实性，并揭示通用模型的不忠实现象。,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.","Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency",Black-box,Medical,该论文的标题和摘要提到评估LLMs生成的解释的可信度，特别是关注于透明度和可靠性等关键问题。因此，其研究属于黑盒类型，因为它关注的是模型的输出（自然语言解释）而非内部工作原理。领域为医学，因为研究应用于医疗保健领域，强调在该敏感领域中解释的可信度和透明度。

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly adept at nuanced language tasks, questions arise about whether—and how—they can assist in large-scale coding without eroding the interpretive depth that distinguishes qualitative analysis from traditional machine learning and other quantitative approaches to natural language processing. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that preserves hermeneutic value while incorporating LLMs to scale the application of codes to large data sets that are impractical for manual coding. Our workflow retains the traditional cycle of codebook development and refinement, adding an iterative step to adapt definitions for machine comprehension, before ultimately replacing manual with automated text categorization. We demonstrate how to rewrite code descriptions for LLM-interpretation, as well as how structured prompts and prompting the model to explain its coding decisions (chain-of-thought) can substantially improve fidelity. Empirically, our case study of socio-historical codes highlights the promise of frontier AI language models to reliably interpret paragraph-long passages representative of a humanistic study. Throughout, we emphasize ethical and practical considerations, preserving space for critical reflection, and the ongoing need for human researchers’ interpretive leadership.

Directly using such rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation, a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision. The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling reasoning-aware supervision.

Recent research has examined whether these self-explanations faithfully reflect the models'actual behavior and has found that they often lack faithfulness. However, the question of how to improve faithfulness remains underexplored. Moreover, because different explanation styles have superficially distinct characteristics, it is unclear whether improvements observed in one style also arise when using other styles. This study analyzes the effects of training for faithful self-explanations and the extent to which these effects generalize, using three classification tasks and three explanation styles. We construct one-word constrained explanations that are likely to be faithful using a feature attribution method, and use these pseudo-faithful self-explanations for continual learning on instruction-tuned models. Our experiments demonstrate that training can improve self-explanation faithfulness across all classification tasks and explanation styles, and that these improvements also show signs of generalization to the multi-word settings and to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we find consistent cross-style generalization among three styles, suggesting that training may contribute to a broader improvement in faithful self-explanation ability.",,White-box,General,该论文研究了如何通过训练提高大型语言模型的自我解释忠实性，涉及模型内部机制和特征归因方法，属于白盒研究。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的模型行为研究。

Auditing Meta-Cognitive Hallucinations in Reasoning Large Language Models,2025,True,True,True,,论文揭示了CoT中的不忠实现象（chain disloyalty），并提出了黑盒审计方法进行度量。,"The development of Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) has significantly improved multi-step reasoning capabilities, but it has also made hallucination problems more frequent and harder to eliminate. While existing approaches mitigate hallucinations through external knowledge integration, model parameter analysis, or self-verification, they often fail to capture how hallucinations emerge and evolve across the reasoning chain. In this work, we study the causality of hallucinations under constrained knowledge domains by auditing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) trajectory and assessing the model's cognitive confidence in potentially erroneous or biased claims. Our analysis reveals that in long-CoT settings, RLLMs can iteratively reinforce biases and errors through flawed reflective reasoning, eventually leading to hallucinated reasoning paths. Surprisingly, even direct interventions at the origin of hallucinations often fail to reverse their effects, as reasoning chains exhibit'chain disloyalty'-- a resistance to correction and a tendency to preserve flawed logic. Furthermore, we show that existing hallucination detection methods are less reliable and interpretable than previously assumed in complex reasoning scenarios. Unlike methods such as circuit tracing that require access to model internals, our black-box auditing approach supports interpretable long-chain hallucination attribution, offering better generalizability and practical utility.

Explainable Multi-Hop Question Answering: A Rationale-Based Approach,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出了一种基于推理的框架，旨在提高模型推理过程的透明度和忠实性。,"Multi-hop question answering tasks involve identifying relevant supporting sentences from a given set of documents, which serve as the rationale for deriving answers. Most research in this area consists of two main components: a rationale identification module and a reader module. Since the rationale identification module often relies on retrieval models or supervised learning, annotated rationales are typically essential. This reliance on annotations, however, creates challenges when adapting to open-domain settings. Moreover, when models are trained on annotated rationales, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) requires clear explanations of how the model arrives at these rationales. Consequently, traditional multi-hop question answering (QA) approaches that depend on annotated rationales are ill-suited for XAI, which demands transparency in the model’s reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a rationale reasoning framework that can effectively infer rationales and clearly demonstrate the model’s reasoning process, even in open-domain environments without annotations. The proposed model is applicable to various tasks without structural constraints, and experimental results demonstrate its significantly improved rationale reasoning capabilities in multi-hop question answering, relation extraction, and sentence classification tasks.",Big Data and Cognitive Computing,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种基于推理的多跳问答框架，旨在解释模型如何得出答案的推理过程，这涉及到模型内部机制的解释，因此属于白盒方法。任务领域是多跳问答，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用领域。
CoT-Kinetics: A Theoretical Modeling Assessing LRM Reasoning Process,2025,True,False,True,,论文提出了一种评估推理轨迹质量的新方法，与 CoT 忠实性相关。,"Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process, which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated reasoning.

When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models'privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable).

LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring,2025,True,True,False,,论文揭示了模型在CoT监控下故意表现不佳的不忠实现象。,"Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed.

Since smaller language models (SLMs) are computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD. However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness.

Their neural networks have proven challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i) LLMs can accurately describe quantitative features of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making and ii) that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training. To do so, we fine-tuned GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts (e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different attributes (e.g., the relative importance of natural light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves the ability of the models to accurately explain how they make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have been fine-tuned to make.

On 4 domains, we systematically evaluate 6 LLMs including 4 large reasoning models with inference-time scaling, paired with 5 pipelines including 2 types of formalism. We show that in few-shot settings, LLM-as-formalizer underperforms LLM-as-solver. While LLM-as-formalizer promises accuracy, robustness, faithfulness, and efficiency, we observe that the present LLMs do not yet deliver any of those, as their limited ability to generate formal programs leads to failure to scale with complexity, hard-coded solutions, and excessive reasoning tokens.

Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions,2025,True,True,False,"Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文讨论了CoT的不忠实现象，并提出了QuaSAR方法来提升Faithfulness。,"Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language.

Latent Veracity Inference for Identifying Errors in Stepwise Reasoning,2025,True,True,True,"Training & Fine-tuning, Verification & External Tools, Prompting & In-Context Learning",论文提出验证推理步骤正确性的方法，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement.",,White-box,General,该论文提出了一种通过潜在正确性变量增强 Chain-of-Thought 推理的方法，并引入了 Veracity Search 算法和 Amortized Veracity Inference 机器。这些方法涉及对模型内部推理机制和潜在变量的操作，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及逻辑、数学和常识推理，但未明确限定于某一特定领域，因此归类为通用领域。
From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出TRM方法，通过强化学习改进CoT忠实性与正确性评估。,"Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,论文提出了一种新的奖励模型（TRM），涉及模型内部机制和句子级别的思考监督，属于白盒方法。任务领域涉及开放领域问答，不属于特定的数学、逻辑、代码或医学领域，因此归类为通用领域。
Formal Reasoning for Intelligent QA Systems: A Case Study in the Educational Domain,2025,True,True,True,Verification & External Tools,论文讨论了LLM推理的不忠实现象，并提出了结合符号引擎的改进方法。,"Reasoning is essential for closed-domain QA systems in which procedural correctness and policy compliance are critical. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on many reasoning tasks, recent work reveals that their reasoning traces are often unfaithful—serving more as plausible justifications than as causally grounded derivations. Efforts to combine LLMs with symbolic engines (e.g., Prover9, Z3) have improved reliability but remain limited to static forms of logic, struggling with dynamic, state-based reasoning such as multi-step progressions and conditional transitions. In this paper, we propose MCFR (Model Checking for Formal Reasoning), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates LLMs with model checking to support property verification. MCFR translates natural language into formal specifications and verifies them over transition models. To support evaluation, we introduce EduMC-QA, a benchmark dataset grounded in real academic procedures. Our results show that MCFR improves reasoning faithfulness and interpretability, offering a viable path toward verifiable QA in high-stakes closed-domain applications.

Is Long-to-Short a Free Lunch? Investigating Inconsistency and Reasoning Efficiency in LRMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了LRMs中的不一致性，包括推理与自我解释的不一致，揭示了不忠实现象。,"Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex tasks by engaging in extended reasoning before producing final answers, yet this strength introduces the risk of overthinking, where excessive token generation occurs even for simple tasks. While recent work in efficient reasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it remains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the intuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model responses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether efficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To systematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to measure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across task settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned behavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and self-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs, we find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than smaller ones, they all display widespread""scheming""behaviors, including self-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning cues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies such as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three defined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient reasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative to ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading effective supervision.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文研究了大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中的不一致性和效率问题，涉及模型内部推理机制和行为分析，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是关注模型的一般行为和效率，因此归类为通用领域。

To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities. These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants.",,White-box,Society,论文研究大型语言模型的谄媚行为（sycophancy），这属于社会心理学和AI伦理领域。方法涉及模型内部推理机制优化（Monte Carlo树搜索、强化学习训练推理轨迹），属于白盒方法。

Counterfactual simulatability has been previously studied for yes/no question answering tasks. We provide a general framework for extending this method to generation tasks, using news summarization and medical suggestion as example use cases. We find that while LLM explanations do enable users to better predict LLM outputs on counterfactuals in the summarization setting, there is significant room for improvement for medical suggestion.

To mitigate these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for these behaviors.

We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative""thinking mode""is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation.

VisFIS: Visual Feature Importance Supervision with Right-for-the-Right-Reason Objectives,2022,True,True,True,Training & Fine-tuning,论文讨论了模型解释的忠实性，并提出了改进方法。,"Many past works aim to improve visual reasoning in models by supervising feature importance (estimated by model explanation techniques) with human annotations such as highlights of important image regions. However, recent work has shown that performance gains from feature importance (FI) supervision for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks persist even with random supervision, suggesting that these methods do not meaningfully align model FI with human FI. In this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA model accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason (RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate predictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2) max-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3) invariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and (4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations (Plausibility). Our best performing method, Visual Feature Importance Supervision (VisFIS), outperforms strong baselines on benchmark VQA datasets in terms of both in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy. While past work suggests that the mechanism for improved accuracy is through improved explanation plausibility, we show that this relationship depends crucially on explanation faithfulness (whether explanations truly represent the model's internal reasoning). Predictions are more accurate when explanations are plausible and faithful, and not when they are plausible but not faithful. Lastly, we show that, surprisingly, RRR metrics are not predictive of out-of-distribution model accuracy when controlling for a model's in-distribution accuracy, which calls into question the value of these metrics for evaluating model reasoning.

Constraints-of-Thought: A Framework for Constrained Reasoning in Language-Model-Guided Search,2025,True,True,False,Verification & External Tools,论文提出了 Const-o-T 框架，通过约束引导推理，提高忠实性和规划效率。,"While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints, especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions, improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment.

However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.",arXiv.org,White-box,Society,该论文研究了基于推理的大型语言模型在内部思考过程中如何聚合社会偏见，并揭示了两种导致社会偏见聚合的失败模式。研究涉及模型内部机制和思考过程，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及社会偏见，属于社会学领域。

To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking""Which answer is most likely?"", DRN asks""Which hypothesis has the most internally consistent evidence?"". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs. Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable reasoning principles.

Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Language Models via Symbolically-Guided Monte Carlo Process Supervision,2025,True,True,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文提出通过符号化方法和微调提升推理忠实性，涉及不忠实现象和改进方法。,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in many reasoning benchmarks. However, recent studies have pointed to memorization, rather than generalization, as one of the leading causes for such performance. LLMs, in fact, are susceptible to content variations, demonstrating a lack of robust planning or symbolic abstractions supporting their reasoning process. To improve reliability, many attempts have been made to combine LLMs with symbolic methods. Nevertheless, existing approaches fail to effectively leverage symbolic representations due to the challenges involved in developing reliable and scalable verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose to overcome such limitations by synthesizing high-quality symbolic reasoning trajectories with stepwise pseudo-labels at scale via Monte Carlo estimation. A Process Reward Model (PRM) can be efficiently trained based on the synthesized data and then used to select more symbolic trajectories. The trajectories are then employed with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to improve logical reasoning and generalization. Our results on benchmarks (i.e., FOLIO and LogicAsker) show the effectiveness of the proposed method with gains on frontier and open-weight models.

CARENLI routes each premise, statement pair to a family specific solver and enforces auditable procedures via a planner, verifier, and refiner. Across four LLMs, CARENLI improves fidelity by up to 42 points, reaching 98.0% in Causal Attribution and 81.2% in Risk State Abstraction. Verifiers flag violations with near-ceiling reliability, while refiners correct a substantial share of epistemic errors.

Existing safety pipelines treat deception as a black-box output to be filtered post-hoc, leaving the model free to scheme during its internal reasoning. We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is thinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a Self-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During generation, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an internal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned strategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement learning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and discourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we introduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert alignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that unrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT Monitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task accuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge in RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and retain transparency.

Human-Aligned Faithfulness in Toxicity Explanations of LLMs,2025,True,True,True,,论文提出新度量标准HAF评估LLMs毒性解释的忠实性，揭示了不一致和不相关响应现象。,"The discourse around toxicity and LLMs in NLP largely revolves around detection tasks. This work shifts the focus to evaluating LLMs'reasoning about toxicity -- from their explanations that justify a stance -- to enhance their trustworthiness in downstream tasks. Despite extensive research on explainability, it is not straightforward to adopt existing methods to evaluate free-form toxicity explanation due to their over-reliance on input text perturbations, among other challenges. To account for these, we propose a novel, theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional criterion, Human-Aligned Faithfulness (HAF), that measures the extent to which LLMs'free-form toxicity explanations align with those of a rational human under ideal conditions. We develop six metrics, based on uncertainty quantification, to comprehensively evaluate HAF of LLMs'toxicity explanations with no human involvement, and highlight how""non-ideal""the explanations are. We conduct several experiments on three Llama models (of size up to 70B) and an 8B Ministral model on five diverse toxicity datasets.

Our work introduces a novel, fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns, enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified phenomenon we term ``inconsistent''reasoning - correctly reasoning before abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting Obscures Hallucination Cues in Large Language Models: An Empirical Evaluation,2025,True,True,True,,论文探讨了CoT提示对幻觉检测的影响，揭示了不忠实现象并提出了评估框架。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations}, generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the use of reasoning.

FRAME: Evaluating Rationale-Label Consistency Metrics for Free-Text Rationales,2022,True,True,True,,论文讨论了自由文本理由的忠实性问题，并提出了评估框架FRAME，涉及不忠实现象和度量指标。,"Following how humans communicate, free-text rationales aim to use natural language to explain neural language model (LM) behavior. However, free-text rationales' unconstrained nature makes them prone to hallucination, so it is important to have metrics for free-text rationale quality. Existing free-text rationale metrics measure how consistent the rationale is with the LM's predicted label, but there is no protocol for assessing such metrics' reliability. Thus, we propose FRAME, a framework for evaluating rationale-label consistency (RLC) metrics for free-text rationales. FRAME is based on three axioms: (1) good metrics should yield highest scores for reference rationales, which maximize RLC by construction; (2) good metrics should be appropriately sensitive to semantic perturbation of rationales; and (3) good metrics should be robust to variation in the LM's task performance. Across three text classification datasets, we show that existing RLC metrics cannot satisfy all three FRAME axioms, since they are implemented via model pretraining which muddles the metric's signal. Then, we introduce a non-pretraining RLC metric that greatly outperforms baselines on (1) and (3), while performing competitively on (2). Finally, we discuss the limitations of using RLC to evaluate free-text rationales.",,White-box,General,该论文研究的是自由文本理由与模型预测标签之间的一致性评估方法，涉及模型内部机制和预测行为，属于白盒方法。任务领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是通用的自然语言处理领域。
Reasoning Can Hurt the Inductive Abilities of Large Language Models,2025,True,True,False,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文揭示了CoT推理可能降低归纳性能的现象，并提出了结构化干预方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains, yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled, diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack - with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning counterparts. To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Logic,该研究通过输入输出和Prompting（如chain-of-thought）来评估大型语言模型的归纳推理能力，并未涉及模型内部机制，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域聚焦于逻辑推理（归纳推理）和游戏规则推断，故归类为Logic。

LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks: sentiment analysis, controversial-topic detection, and safety-prompt auditing. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with the explanations it provides.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Society,LAMP方法通过分析语言模型的自我报告解释来研究其决策表面，而不需要访问模型的梯度、logits或内部激活值，因此属于黑盒方法。研究涉及情感分析、争议话题检测和安全提示审核等任务，这些都属于社会学领域。

Knowing Before Saying: LLM Representations Encode Information About Chain-of-Thought Success Before Completion,2025,False,False,False,Training & Fine-tuning,论文研究CoT成功预测，未涉及忠实性或不忠实现象。,"We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all, though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,White-box,General,该论文研究了LLM在零样本思维链（CoT）过程中的内部表示，通过探测分类器基于LLM的表示来预测CoT的成功与否，这表明研究涉及模型内部机制和表示，因此属于白盒方法。研究领域不特定于数学、逻辑、代码或医学，而是关注LLM的一般推理过程，因此归类为通用领域。
WakenLLM: Evaluating Reasoning Potential and Stability in LLMs via Fine-Grained Benchmarking,2025,True,True,True,Prompting & In-Context Learning,论文探讨了LLM在推理任务中的不忠实现象，并提出了新的评估框架和改进方法。,"Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently output the label Unknown in reasoning tasks, where two scenarios may appear: (i) an input sample is genuinely unverifiable, but the model cannot understand why; and (ii) a verifiable problem that the model fails to solve, thus outputs Unknown. We refer to these cases collectively as the Vague Perception phenomenon. Current evaluations focus on whether such answers are honest, rather than analyzing the limits of LLM reasoning. To address this, we introduce WakenLLM, a framework that quantifies the portion of Unknown output attributable to model incapacity and evaluates whether stimulation can convert them into either correct answers (verifiable) or justified (unverifiable) responses with valid reasoning. Our method offers a clearer picture of the limits of LLM reasoning and the potential for corrections across various datasets. Comprehensive experiments on six LLMs suggest that, without any training or parameter revision, LLMs can achieve up to a 68.53% accuracy improvement on Vague Perception samples through guided understanding. Our work reveals that current baseline methods only activate a small portion of LLMs'reasoning potential, indicating considerable unexplored capacity. This extends the theoretical upper bounds of reasoning accuracy in LLMs. Consequently, this study deepens our understanding of the latent reasoning capacity of LLMs and offers a new perspective on addressing the Vague Perception phenomenon.",arXiv.org,Black-box,General,该研究通过输入输出和Prompting（引导理解）来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理潜力和稳定性，并未涉及模型内部机制或权重调整。研究领域为通用推理能力评估，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学。
Controlling Large Language Model Agents with Entropic Activation Steering,2024,True,False,False,Interpretability & Internal Mechanisms,论文提出通过激活导向控制LLM代理的探索行为，涉及内部机制干预。,"The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors.",arXiv.org,White-box,General,该论文通过直接操作大型语言模型（LLM）的内部表示（激活值）来控制代理的探索行为，属于白盒方法。研究领域涉及LLM代理的决策行为控制，不特定于数学、逻辑、代码、医学或社会学，因此归类为通用领域。

In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark that is meant to capture the amplification of social bias, via stigmas, in generative language models. Taking inspiration from social science research, we start with a documented list of 93 US-centric stigmas and curate a question-answering (QA) dataset which involves simple social situations. Our benchmark, SocialStigmaQA, contains roughly 10K prompts, with a variety of prompt styles, carefully constructed to systematically test for both social bias and model robustness. We present results for SocialStigmaQA with two open source generative language models and we find that the proportion of socially biased output ranges from 45% to 59% across a variety of decoding strategies and prompting styles. We demonstrate that the deliberate design of the templates in our benchmark (e.g., adding biasing text to the prompt or using different verbs that change the answer that indicates bias) impacts the model tendencies to generate socially biased output. Additionally, through manual evaluation, we discover problematic patterns in the generated chain-of-thought output that range from subtle bias to lack of reasoning.

Addressing these two challenges, we propose the first study of the robustness of formal and informal LLM-based deductive reasoning methods. We devise a framework with two families of perturbations: adversarial noise and counterfactual statements, which jointly generate seven perturbed datasets. We organize the landscape of LLM reasoners according to their reasoning format, formalisation syntax, and feedback for error recovery. The results show that adversarial noise affects autoformalisation, while counterfactual statements influence all approaches.

Causal abstraction provides a precise notion of when a network implements an algorithm, i.e., a causal model of the network contains low-level features that realize the high-level variables in a causal model of the algorithm. A typical problem in practical settings is that the algorithm is not an entirely faithful abstraction of the network, meaning it only partially captures the true reasoning process of a model. We propose a solution where we combine different simple high-level models to produce a more faithful representation of the network. Through learning this combination, we can model neural networks as being in different computational states depending on the input provided, which we show is more accurate to GPT 2-small fine-tuned on two toy tasks. We observe a trade-off between the strength of an interpretability hypothesis, which we define in terms of the number of inputs explained by the high-level models, and its faithfulness, which we define as the interchange intervention accuracy.

While such approaches improve performance, they do not consider the relations between intermediate steps across chains and do not provide a unified explanation for the predicted answer.

This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain.

Bias and Toxicity in Zero-Shot Reasoning",2022,False,True,False,,论文探讨了CoT在敏感领域中的负面影响，但未涉及Faithfulness的核心定义。,"Generating a Chain of Thought (CoT) has been shown to consistently improve large language model (LLM) performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. However, prior work has mainly focused on logical reasoning tasks (e.g. arithmetic, commonsense QA); it remains unclear whether improvements hold for more diverse types of reasoning, especially in socially situated contexts. Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a model’s likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output, with trends holding across different prompt formats and model variants. Furthermore, we show that harmful CoTs increase with model size, but decrease with improved instruction following. Our work suggests that zero-shot CoT should be used with caution on socially important tasks, especially when marginalized groups or sensitive topics are involved.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,Black-box,Society,该研究通过输入输出（Prompting）评估零样本思维链（CoT）在社会敏感领域的影响，属于黑盒方法。研究关注的是社会敏感领域中的偏见和毒性问题，涉及社会学领域。

The quality of the retrieved evidence plays an important role in claim verification. Ideally, the retrieved evidence should be faithful (reflecting the model's decision-making process in claim verification) and plausible (convincing to humans), and can improve the accuracy of verification task. Although existing approaches leverage the similarity measure of semantic or surface form between claims and documents to retrieve evidence, they all rely on certain heuristics that prevent them from satisfying all three requirements. In light of this, we propose a fact verification model named ReRead to retrieve evidence and verify claim that: (1) Train the evidence retriever to obtain interpretable evidence (i.e., faithfulness and plausibility criteria); (2) Train the claim verifier to revisit the evidence retrieved by the optimized evidence retriever to improve the accuracy.

An important consideration in designing them is faithfulness, i.e. generating explanations that accurately reflect the reasoning of the model. Recent works have focused on natural logic, which operates directly on natural language by capturing the semantic relation of spans between an aligned claim with its evidence via set-theoretic operators. However, these approaches rely on substantial resources for training, which are only available for high-resource languages. To this end, we propose to use question answering to predict natural logic operators, taking advantage of the generalization capabilities of instruction-tuned language models. Thus, we obviate the need for annotated training data while still relying on a deterministic inference system. In a few-shot setting on FEVER, our approach outperforms the best baseline by $4.3$ accuracy points, including a state-of-the-art pre-trained seq2seq natural logic system, as well as a state-of-the-art prompt-based classifier.

However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems.

Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability. Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability in future frontier models.",arXiv.org,Black-box,Code,该研究通过测试模型在加密文本中的推理能力来评估其性能，主要关注的是模型的输入输出行为（Prompting），并未涉及模型内部机制的分析，因此属于黑盒方法。研究领域涉及代码（加密文本的处理和推理），因此归类为Code。

While several techniques exist to interpret their predictions, very few of them are as intuitive and accessible as natural language explanations (NLEs). To build trust, such explanations must faithfully capture the classifier's internal decision making behavior, a property known as faithfulness. In this paper, we propose CAuSE (Causal Abstraction under Simulated Explanations), a novel framework to generate faithful NLEs for any pretrained multimodal classifier. We demonstrate that CAuSE generalizes across datasets and models through extensive empirical evaluations. Theoretically, we show that CAuSE, trained via interchange intervention, forms a causal abstraction of the underlying classifier. We further validate this through a redesigned metric for measuring causal faithfulness in multimodal settings. CAuSE surpasses other methods on this metric, with qualitative analysis reinforcing its advantages. We perform detailed error analysis to pinpoint the failure cases of CAuSE.

We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors.

We reformulate faithfulness as an accurate attribution of causality to the model, and introduce the concept of aligned faithfulness: faithful causal chains that are aligned with their expected social behavior. The two steps of causal attribution and social attribution together complete the process of explaining behavior. With this formalization, we characterize various failures of misaligned faithful highlight interpretations, and propose an alternative causal chain to remedy the issues. Finally, we implement highlight explanations of the proposed causal format using contrastive explanations.",Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics,White-box,Society,该论文研究模型解释的忠实性问题，涉及模型内部决策的因果链（causal attribution）和人类行为解释的社会归因（social attribution）之间的对齐问题。这属于白盒方法，因为它涉及模型内部机制和解释的因果链。研究领域属于社会学，因为它关注模型解释的社会行为和人类行为归因。

Rationale extraction aims to provide faithful (i.e. reflective of the behavior of the model) and plausible (i.e. convincing to humans) explanations by highlighting the inputs that had the largest impact on the prediction without compromising the performance of the task model. In recent works, the focus of training rationale extractors was primarily on optimizing for plausibility using human highlights, while the task model was trained on jointly optimizing for task predictive accuracy and faithfulness. We propose REFER, a framework that employs a differentiable rationale extractor that allows to back-propagate through the rationale extraction process. We analyze the impact of using human highlights during training by jointly training the task model and the rationale extractor. In our experiments, REFER yields significantly better results in terms of faithfulness, plausibility, and downstream task accuracy on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).",International Conference on Machine Learning,White-box,Society,该论文研究了自解释框架中的潜在偏差问题，涉及生成器和预测器的内部协作机制，属于白盒方法。研究内容关注于数据集中的虚假相关性及其社会影响，因此归类为社会学领域。

To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models'abilities to perform moral reasoning.

Moreover, as Self-Correction functions like the slow and conscious System-2 thinking from cognitive psychology's perspective, it can potentially reduce LLMs' social biases. LLMs are sensitive to contextual ambiguities and inconsistencies; therefore, explicitly communicating their intentions during interactions when applying Self-Correction for debiasing is crucial. In this study, we demonstrate that clarifying intentions is essential for effectively reducing biases in LLMs through Self-Correction. We divide the components needed for Self-Correction into three parts: instruction, response, and feedback, and clarify intentions at each component. We incorporate an explicit debiasing prompt to convey the intention of bias mitigation from the instruction for response generation. In the response, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to clarify the reasoning process. In the feedback, we define evaluation aspects necessary for debiasing and propose clear feedback through multi-aspect critiques and scoring. Through experiments, we demonstrate that self-correcting CoT responses obtained from a debiasing prompt based on multi-aspect feedback can reduce biased responses more robustly and consistently than the baselines.
